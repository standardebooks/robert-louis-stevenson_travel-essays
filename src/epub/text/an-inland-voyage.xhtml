<h2>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> equip so small a book with a
preface is, I am half afraid, to sin against proportion.&nbsp;
But a preface is more than an author can resist, for it is the
reward of his labours.&nbsp; When the foundation stone is laid,
the architect appears with his plans, and struts for an hour
before the public eye.&nbsp; So with the writer in his preface:
he may have never a word to say, but he must show himself for a
moment in the portico, hat in hand, and with an urbane
demeanour.</p>
<p>It is best, in such circumstances, to represent a delicate
shade of manner between humility and superiority: as if the book
had been written by some one else, and you had merely run over it
and inserted what was good.&nbsp; But for my part I have not yet
learned the trick to that perfection; I am not yet able to
dissemble the warmth of my sentiments towards a reader; and if I
meet him on the threshold, it is to invite him in with country
cordiality.</p>
<p>To say truth, I had no sooner finished reading this little
book in proof, than I was seized upon by a distressing
apprehension.&nbsp; It occurred to me that I might not only be
the first to read these pages, but the last as well; that I might
have pioneered this very smiling tract of country all in vain,
and find not a soul to follow in my steps.&nbsp; The more I
thought, the more I disliked the notion; until the distaste grew
into a sort of panic terror, and I rushed into this Preface,
which is no more than an advertisement for readers.</p>
<p>What am I to say for my book?&nbsp; Caleb and Joshua brought
back from Palestine a formidable bunch of grapes; alas! my book
produces naught so nourishing; and for the matter of that, we
live in an age when people prefer a definition to any quantity of
fruit.</p>
<p>I wonder, would a negative be found enticing? for, from the
negative point of view, I flatter myself this volume has a
certain stamp.&nbsp; Although it runs to considerably upwards of
two hundred pages, it contains not a single reference to the
imbecility of God&rsquo;s universe, nor so much as a single hint
that I could have made a better one myself.&mdash;I really do not
know where my head can have been.&nbsp; I seem to have forgotten
all that makes it glorious to be man.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis an
omission that renders the book philosophically unimportant; but I
am in hopes the eccentricity may please in frivolous circles.</p>
<p>To the friend who accompanied me I owe many thanks already,
indeed I wish I owed him nothing else; but at this moment I feel
towards him an almost exaggerated tenderness.&nbsp; He, at least,
will become my reader:&mdash;if it were only to follow his own
travels alongside of mine.</p>

<h2><i>TO</i><br />
<i>SIR WALTER GRINDLAY SIMPSON</i>, <i>BART.</i></h2>
<p><i>My dear Cigarette</i>,</p>
<p><i>It was enough that you should have shared so liberally in
the rains and portages of our voyage</i>; <i>that you should have
had so hard a paddle to recover the derelict</i>
&lsquo;<i>Arethusa</i>&rsquo; <i>on the flooded Oise</i>; <i>and
that you should thenceforth have piloted a mere wreck of mankind
to Origny Sainte-Beno&icirc;te and a supper so eagerly
desired</i>.&nbsp; <i>It was perhaps more than enough</i>, <i>as
you once somewhat piteously complained</i>, <i>that I should have
set down all the strong language to you</i>, <i>and kept the
appropriate reflexions for myself</i>.&nbsp; <i>I could not in
decency expose you to share the disgrace of another and more
public shipwreck</i>.&nbsp; <i>But now that this voyage of ours
is going into a cheap edition</i>, <i>that peril</i>, <i>we shall
hope</i>, <i>is at an end</i>, <i>and I may put your name on the
burgee</i>.</p>
<p><i>But I cannot pause till I have lamented the fate of our two
ships</i>.&nbsp; <i>That</i>, <i>sir</i>, <i>was not a fortunate
day when we projected the possession of a canal barge</i>; <i>it
was not a fortunate day when we shared our day-dream with the
most hopeful of day-dreamers</i>.&nbsp; <i>For a while</i>,
<i>indeed</i>, <i>the world looked smilingly</i>.&nbsp; <i>The
barge was procured and christened</i>, <i>and as the</i>
&lsquo;<i>Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne</i>,&rsquo; <i>lay
for some months</i>, <i>the admired of all admirers</i>, <i>in a
pleasant river and under the walls of an ancient town</i>.&nbsp;
<i>M. Mattras</i>, <i>the accomplished carpenter of Moret</i>,
<i>had made her a centre of emulous labour</i>; <i>and you will
not have forgotten the amount of sweet champagne consumed in the
inn at the bridge end</i>, <i>to give zeal to the workmen and
speed to the work</i>.&nbsp; <i>On the financial aspect</i>, <i>I
would not willingly dwell</i>.&nbsp; <i>The</i> &lsquo;<i>Eleven
Thousand Virgins of Cologne</i>&rsquo; <i>rotted in the stream
where she was beautified</i>.&nbsp; <i>She felt not the impulse
of the breeze</i>; <i>she was never harnessed to the patient
track-horse</i>.&nbsp; <i>And when at length she was sold</i>,
<i>by the indignant carpenter of Moret</i>, <i>there were sold
along with her the</i> &lsquo;<i>Arethusa</i>&rsquo; <i>and
the</i> &lsquo;<i>Cigarette</i>,&rsquo; <i>she of cedar</i>,
<i>she</i>, <i>as we knew so keenly on a portage</i>, <i>of
solid-hearted English oak</i>.&nbsp; <i>Now these historic
vessels fly the tricolor and are known by new and alien
names</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>ANTWERP
TO BOOM</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> made a great stir in Antwerp
Docks.&nbsp; A stevedore and a lot of dock porters took up the
two canoes, and ran with them for the slip.&nbsp; A crowd of
children followed cheering.&nbsp; The <i>Cigarette</i> went off
in a splash and a bubble of small breaking water.&nbsp; Next
moment the <i>Arethusa</i> was after her.&nbsp; A steamer was
coming down, men on the paddle-box shouted hoarse warnings, the
stevedore and his porters were bawling from the quay.&nbsp; But
in a stroke or two the canoes were away out in the middle of the
Scheldt, and all steamers, and stevedores, and other
&lsquo;long-shore vanities were left behind.</p>
<p>The sun shone brightly; the tide was making&mdash;four jolly
miles an hour; the wind blew steadily, with occasional
squalls.&nbsp; For my part, I had never been in a canoe under
sail in my life; and my first experiment out in the middle of
this big river was not made without some trepidation.&nbsp; What
would happen when the wind first caught my little canvas?&nbsp; I
suppose it was almost as trying a venture into the regions of the
unknown as to publish a first book, or to marry.&nbsp; But my
doubts were not of long duration; and in five minutes you will
not be surprised to learn that I had tied my sheet.</p>
<p>I own I was a little struck by this circumstance myself; of
course, in company with the rest of my fellow-men, I had always
tied the sheet in a sailing-boat; but in so little and crank a
concern as a canoe, and with these charging squalls, I was not
prepared to find myself follow the same principle; and it
inspired me with some contemptuous views of our regard for
life.&nbsp; It is certainly easier to smoke with the sheet
fastened; but I had never before weighed a comfortable pipe of
tobacco against an obvious risk, and gravely elected for the
comfortable pipe.&nbsp; It is a commonplace, that we cannot
answer for ourselves before we have been tried.&nbsp; But it is
not so common a reflection, and surely more consoling, that we
usually find ourselves a great deal braver and better than we
thought.&nbsp; I believe this is every one&rsquo;s experience:
but an apprehension that they may belie themselves in the future
prevents mankind from trumpeting this cheerful sentiment
abroad.&nbsp; I wish sincerely, for it would have saved me much
trouble, there had been some one to put me in a good heart about
life when I was younger; to tell me how dangers are most
portentous on a distant sight; and how the good in a man&rsquo;s
spirit will not suffer itself to be overlaid, and rarely or never
deserts him in the hour of need.&nbsp; But we are all for
tootling on the sentimental flute in literature; and not a man
among us will go to the head of the march to sound the heady
drums.</p>
<p>It was agreeable upon the river.&nbsp; A barge or two went
past laden with hay.&nbsp; Reeds and willows bordered the stream;
and cattle and grey venerable horses came and hung their mild
heads over the embankment.&nbsp; Here and there was a pleasant
village among trees, with a noisy shipping-yard; here and there a
villa in a lawn.&nbsp; The wind served us well up the Scheldt and
thereafter up the Rupel; and we were running pretty free when we
began to sight the brickyards of Boom, lying for a long way on
the right bank of the river.&nbsp; The left bank was still green
and pastoral, with alleys of trees along the embankment, and here
and there a flight of steps to serve a ferry, where perhaps there
sat a woman with her elbows on her knees, or an old gentleman
with a staff and silver spectacles.&nbsp; But Boom and its
brickyards grew smokier and shabbier with every minute; until a
great church with a clock, and a wooden bridge over the river,
indicated the central quarters of the town.</p>
<p>Boom is not a nice place, and is only remarkable for one
thing: that the majority of the inhabitants have a private
opinion that they can speak English, which is not justified by
fact.&nbsp; This gave a kind of haziness to our
intercourse.&nbsp; As for the H&ocirc;tel de la Navigation, I
think it is the worst feature of the place.&nbsp; It boasts of a
sanded parlour, with a bar at one end, looking on the street; and
another sanded parlour, darker and colder, with an empty
bird-cage and a tricolour subscription box by way of sole
adornment, where we made shift to dine in the company of three
uncommunicative engineer apprentices and a silent bagman.&nbsp;
The food, as usual in Belgium, was of a nondescript occasional
character; indeed I have never been able to detect anything in
the nature of a meal among this pleasing people; they seem to
peck and trifle with viands all day long in an amateur spirit:
tentatively French, truly German, and somehow falling between the
two.</p>
<p>The empty bird-cage, swept and garnished, and with no trace of
the old piping favourite, save where two wires had been pushed
apart to hold its lump of sugar, carried with it a sort of
graveyard cheer.&nbsp; The engineer apprentices would have
nothing to say to us, nor indeed to the bagman; but talked low
and sparingly to one another, or raked us in the gaslight with a
gleam of spectacles.&nbsp; For though handsome lads, they were
all (in the Scots phrase) barnacled.</p>
<p>There was an English maid in the hotel, who had been long
enough out of England to pick up all sorts of funny foreign
idioms, and all sorts of curious foreign ways, which need not
here be specified.&nbsp; She spoke to us very fluently in her
jargon, asked us information as to the manners of the present day
in England, and obligingly corrected us when we attempted to
answer.&nbsp; But as we were dealing with a woman, perhaps our
information was not so much thrown away as it appeared.&nbsp; The
sex likes to pick up knowledge and yet preserve its
superiority.&nbsp; It is good policy, and almost necessary in the
circumstances.&nbsp; If a man finds a woman admire him, were it
only for his acquaintance with geography, he will begin at once
to build upon the admiration.&nbsp; It is only by unintermittent
snubbing that the pretty ones can keep us in our place.&nbsp;
Men, as Miss Howe or Miss Harlowe would have said, &lsquo;are
such <i>encroachers</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; For my part, I am body and
soul with the women; and after a well-married couple, there is
nothing so beautiful in the world as the myth of the divine
huntress.&nbsp; It is no use for a man to take to the woods; we
know him; St. Anthony tried the same thing long ago, and had a
pitiful time of it by all accounts.&nbsp; But there is this about
some women, which overtops the best gymnosophist among men, that
they suffice to themselves, and can walk in a high and cold zone
without the countenance of any trousered being.&nbsp; I declare,
although the reverse of a professed ascetic, I am more obliged to
women for this ideal than I should be to the majority of them, or
indeed to any but one, for a spontaneous kiss.&nbsp; There is
nothing so encouraging as the spectacle of
self-sufficiency.&nbsp; And when I think of the slim and lovely
maidens, running the woods all night to the note of Diana&rsquo;s
horn; moving among the old oaks, as fancy-free as they; things of
the forest and the starlight, not touched by the commotion of
man&rsquo;s hot and turbid life&mdash;although there are plenty
other ideals that I should prefer&mdash;I find my heart beat at
the thought of this one.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis to fail in life, but to
fail with what a grace!&nbsp; That is not lost which is not
regretted.&nbsp; And where&mdash;here slips out the
male&mdash;where would be much of the glory of inspiring love, if
there were no contempt to overcome?</p>
<h2><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>ON THE
WILLEBROEK CANAL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning, when we set forth on
the Willebroek Canal, the rain began heavy and chill.&nbsp; The
water of the canal stood at about the drinking temperature of
tea; and under this cold aspersion, the surface was covered with
steam.&nbsp; The exhilaration of departure, and the easy motion
of the boats under each stroke of the paddles, supported us
through this misfortune while it lasted; and when the cloud
passed and the sun came out again, our spirits went up above the
range of stay-at-home humours.&nbsp; A good breeze rustled and
shivered in the rows of trees that bordered the canal.&nbsp; The
leaves flickered in and out of the light in tumultuous
masses.&nbsp; It seemed sailing weather to eye and ear; but down
between the banks, the wind reached us only in faint and
desultory puffs.&nbsp; There was hardly enough to steer by.&nbsp;
Progress was intermittent and unsatisfactory.&nbsp; A jocular
person, of marine antecedents, hailed us from the tow-path with a
&lsquo;<i>C&rsquo;est vite</i>, <i>mais c&rsquo;est
long</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The canal was busy enough.&nbsp; Every now and then we met or
overtook a long string of boats, with great green tillers; high
sterns with a window on either side of the rudder, and perhaps a
jug or a flower-pot in one of the windows; a dinghy following
behind; a woman busied about the day&rsquo;s dinner, and a
handful of children.&nbsp; These barges were all tied one behind
the other with tow ropes, to the number of twenty-five or thirty;
and the line was headed and kept in motion by a steamer of
strange construction.&nbsp; It had neither paddle-wheel nor
screw; but by some gear not rightly comprehensible to the
unmechanical mind, it fetched up over its bow a small bright
chain which lay along the bottom of the canal, and paying it out
again over the stern, dragged itself forward, link by link, with
its whole retinue of loaded skows.&nbsp; Until one had found out
the key to the enigma, there was something solemn and
uncomfortable in the progress of one of these trains, as it moved
gently along the water with nothing to mark its advance but an
eddy alongside dying away into the wake.</p>
<p>Of all the creatures of commercial enterprise, a canal barge
is by far the most delightful to consider.&nbsp; It may spread
its sails, and then you see it sailing high above the tree-tops
and the windmill, sailing on the aqueduct, sailing through the
green corn-lands: the most picturesque of things
amphibious.&nbsp; Or the horse plods along at a foot-pace as if
there were no such thing as business in the world; and the man
dreaming at the tiller sees the same spire on the horizon all day
long.&nbsp; It is a mystery how things ever get to their
destination at this rate; and to see the barges waiting their
turn at a lock, affords a fine lesson of how easily the world may
be taken.&nbsp; There should be many contented spirits on board,
for such a life is both to travel and to stay at home.</p>
<p>The chimney smokes for dinner as you go along; the banks of
the canal slowly unroll their scenery to contemplative eyes; the
barge floats by great forests and through great cities with their
public buildings and their lamps at night; and for the bargee, in
his floating home, &lsquo;travelling abed,&rsquo; it is merely as
if he were listening to another man&rsquo;s story or turning the
leaves of a picture-book in which he had no concern.&nbsp; He may
take his afternoon walk in some foreign country on the banks of
the canal, and then come home to dinner at his own fireside.</p>
<p>There is not enough exercise in such a life for any high
measure of health; but a high measure of health is only necessary
for unhealthy people.&nbsp; The slug of a fellow, who is never
ill nor well, has a quiet time of it in life, and dies all the
easier.</p>
<p>I am sure I would rather be a bargee than occupy any position
under heaven that required attendance at an office.&nbsp; There
are few callings, I should say, where a man gives up less of his
liberty in return for regular meals.&nbsp; The bargee is on
shipboard&mdash;he is master in his own ship&mdash;he can land
whenever he will&mdash;he can never be kept beating off a
lee-shore a whole frosty night when the sheets are as hard as
iron; and so far as I can make out, time stands as nearly still
with him as is compatible with the return of bed-time or the
dinner-hour.&nbsp; It is not easy to see why a bargee should ever
die.</p>
<p>Half-way between Willebroek and Villevorde, in a beautiful
reach of canal like a squire&rsquo;s avenue, we went ashore to
lunch.&nbsp; There were two eggs, a junk of bread, and a bottle
of wine on board the <i>Arethusa</i>; and two eggs and an Etna
cooking apparatus on board the <i>Cigarette</i>.&nbsp; The master
of the latter boat smashed one of the eggs in the course of
disembarkation; but observing pleasantly that it might still be
cooked <i>&agrave; la papier</i>, he dropped it into the Etna, in
its covering of Flemish newspaper.&nbsp; We landed in a blink of
fine weather; but we had not been two minutes ashore before the
wind freshened into half a gale, and the rain began to patter on
our shoulders.&nbsp; We sat as close about the Etna as we
could.&nbsp; The spirits burned with great ostentation; the grass
caught flame every minute or two, and had to be trodden out; and
before long, there were several burnt fingers of the party.&nbsp;
But the solid quantity of cookery accomplished was out of
proportion with so much display; and when we desisted, after two
applications of the fire, the sound egg was little more than
loo-warm; and as for <i>&agrave; la papier</i>, it was a cold and
sordid <i>fricass&eacute;e</i> of printer&rsquo;s ink and broken
egg-shell.&nbsp; We made shift to roast the other two, by putting
them close to the burning spirits; and that with better
success.&nbsp; And then we uncorked the bottle of wine, and sat
down in a ditch with our canoe aprons over our knees.&nbsp; It
rained smartly.&nbsp; Discomfort, when it is honestly
uncomfortable and makes no nauseous pretensions to the contrary,
is a vastly humorous business; and people well steeped and
stupefied in the open air are in a good vein for laughter.&nbsp;
From this point of view, even egg <i>&agrave; la papier</i>
offered by way of food may pass muster as a sort of accessory to
the fun.&nbsp; But this manner of jest, although it may be taken
in good part, does not invite repetition; and from that time
forward, the Etna voyaged like a gentleman in the locker of the
<i>Cigarette</i>.</p>
<p>It is almost unnecessary to mention that when lunch was over
and we got aboard again and made sail, the wind promptly died
away.&nbsp; The rest of the journey to Villevorde, we still
spread our canvas to the unfavouring air; and with now and then a
puff, and now and then a spell of paddling, drifted along from
lock to lock, between the orderly trees.</p>
<p>It was a fine, green, fat landscape; or rather a mere green
water-lane, going on from village to village.&nbsp; Things had a
settled look, as in places long lived in.&nbsp; Crop-headed
children spat upon us from the bridges as we went below, with a
true conservative feeling.&nbsp; But even more conservative were
the fishermen, intent upon their floats, who let us go by without
one glance.&nbsp; They perched upon sterlings and buttresses and
along the slope of the embankment, gently occupied.&nbsp; They
were indifferent, like pieces of dead nature.&nbsp; They did not
move any more than if they had been fishing in an old Dutch
print.&nbsp; The leaves fluttered, the water lapped, but they
continued in one stay like so many churches established by
law.&nbsp; You might have trepanned every one of their innocent
heads, and found no more than so much coiled fishing-line below
their skulls.&nbsp; I do not care for your stalwart fellows in
india-rubber stockings breasting up mountain torrents with a
salmon rod; but I do dearly love the class of man who plies his
unfruitful art, for ever and a day, by still and depopulated
waters.</p>
<p>At the last lock, just beyond Villevorde, there was a
lock-mistress who spoke French comprehensibly, and told us we
were still a couple of leagues from Brussels.&nbsp; At the same
place, the rain began again.&nbsp; It fell in straight, parallel
lines; and the surface of the canal was thrown up into an
infinity of little crystal fountains.&nbsp; There were no beds to
be had in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Nothing for it but to lay the
sails aside and address ourselves to steady paddling in the
rain.</p>
<p>Beautiful country houses, with clocks and long lines of
shuttered windows, and fine old trees standing in groves and
avenues, gave a rich and sombre aspect in the rain and the
deepening dusk to the shores of the canal.&nbsp; I seem to have
seen something of the same effect in engravings: opulent
landscapes, deserted and overhung with the passage of
storm.&nbsp; And throughout we had the escort of a hooded cart,
which trotted shabbily along the tow-path, and kept at an almost
uniform distance in our wake.</p>
<h2><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>THE
ROYAL SPORT NAUTIQUE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rain took off near
Laeken.&nbsp; But the sun was already down; the air was chill;
and we had scarcely a dry stitch between the pair of us.&nbsp;
Nay, now we found ourselves near the end of the All&eacute;e
Verte, and on the very threshold of Brussels, we were confronted
by a serious difficulty.&nbsp; The shores were closely lined by
canal boats waiting their turn at the lock.&nbsp; Nowhere was
there any convenient landing-place; nowhere so much as a
stable-yard to leave the canoes in for the night.&nbsp; We
scrambled ashore and entered an <i>estaminet</i> where some sorry
fellows were drinking with the landlord.&nbsp; The landlord was
pretty round with us; he knew of no coach-house or stable-yard,
nothing of the sort; and seeing we had come with no mind to
drink, he did not conceal his impatience to be rid of us.&nbsp;
One of the sorry fellows came to the rescue.&nbsp; Somewhere in
the corner of the basin there was a slip, he informed us, and
something else besides, not very clearly defined by him, but
hopefully construed by his hearers.</p>
<p>Sure enough there was the slip in the corner of the basin; and
at the top of it two nice-looking lads in boating clothes.&nbsp;
The <i>Arethusa</i> addressed himself to these.&nbsp; One of them
said there would be no difficulty about a night&rsquo;s lodging
for our boats; and the other, taking a cigarette from his lips,
inquired if they were made by Searle and Son.&nbsp; The name was
quite an introduction.&nbsp; Half-a-dozen other young men came
out of a boat-house bearing the superscription <span
class="smcap">Royal Sport Nautique</span>, and joined in the
talk.&nbsp; They were all very polite, voluble, and enthusiastic;
and their discourse was interlarded with English boating terms,
and the names of English boat-builders and English clubs.&nbsp; I
do not know, to my shame, any spot in my native land where I
should have been so warmly received by the same number of
people.&nbsp; We were English boating-men, and the Belgian
boating-men fell upon our necks.&nbsp; I wonder if French
Huguenots were as cordially greeted by English Protestants when
they came across the Channel out of great tribulation.&nbsp; But
after all, what religion knits people so closely as a common
sport?</p>
<p>The canoes were carried into the boat-house; they were washed
down for us by the Club servants, the sails were hung out to dry,
and everything made as snug and tidy as a picture.&nbsp; And in
the meanwhile we were led upstairs by our new-found brethren, for
so more than one of them stated the relationship, and made free
of their lavatory.&nbsp; This one lent us soap, that one a towel,
a third and fourth helped us to undo our bags.&nbsp; And all the
time such questions, such assurances of respect and
sympathy!&nbsp; I declare I never knew what glory was before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, the <i>Royal Sport Nautique</i> is the oldest
club in Belgium.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We number two hundred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;&mdash;this is not a substantive speech, but
an abstract of many speeches, the impression left upon my mind
after a great deal of talk; and very youthful, pleasant, natural,
and patriotic it seems to me to be&mdash;&lsquo;We have gained
all races, except those where we were cheated by the
French.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must leave all your wet things to be
dried.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O! <i>entre fr&egrave;res</i>!&nbsp; In any boat-house
in England we should find the same.&rsquo;&nbsp; (I cordially
hope they might.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>En Angleterre</i>, <i>vous employez des
sliding-seats</i>, <i>n&rsquo;est-ce pas</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are all employed in commerce during the day; but in
the evening, <i>voyez-vous</i>, <i>nous sommes
s&eacute;rieux</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These were the words.&nbsp; They were all employed over the
frivolous mercantile concerns of Belgium during the day; but in
the evening they found some hours for the serious concerns of
life.&nbsp; I may have a wrong idea of wisdom, but I think that
was a very wise remark.&nbsp; People connected with literature
and philosophy are busy all their days in getting rid of
second-hand notions and false standards.&nbsp; It is their
profession, in the sweat of their brows, by dogged thinking, to
recover their old fresh view of life, and distinguish what they
really and originally like, from what they have only learned to
tolerate perforce.&nbsp; And these Royal Nautical Sportsmen had
the distinction still quite legible in their hearts.&nbsp; They
had still those clean perceptions of what is nice and nasty, what
is interesting and what is dull, which envious old gentlemen
refer to as illusions.&nbsp; The nightmare illusion of middle
age, the bear&rsquo;s hug of custom gradually squeezing the life
out of a man&rsquo;s soul, had not yet begun for these
happy-starred young Belgians.&nbsp; They still knew that the
interest they took in their business was a trifling affair
compared to their spontaneous, long-suffering affection for
nautical sports.&nbsp; To know what you prefer, instead of humbly
saying Amen to what the world tells you you ought to prefer, is
to have kept your soul alive.&nbsp; Such a man may be generous;
he may be honest in something more than the commercial sense; he
may love his friends with an elective, personal sympathy, and not
accept them as an adjunct of the station to which he has been
called.&nbsp; He may be a man, in short, acting on his own
instincts, keeping in his own shape that God made him in; and not
a mere crank in the social engine-house, welded on principles
that he does not understand, and for purposes that he does not
care for.</p>
<p>For will any one dare to tell me that business is more
entertaining than fooling among boats?&nbsp; He must have never
seen a boat, or never seen an office, who says so.&nbsp; And for
certain the one is a great deal better for the health.&nbsp;
There should be nothing so much a man&rsquo;s business as his
amusements.&nbsp; Nothing but money-grubbing can be put forward
to the contrary; no one but</p>
<blockquote><p>Mammon, the least erected spirit that fell<br />
From Heaven,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>durst risk a word in answer.&nbsp; It is but a lying cant that
would represent the merchant and the banker as people
disinterestedly toiling for mankind, and then most useful when
they are most absorbed in their transactions; for the man is more
important than his services.&nbsp; And when my Royal Nautical
Sportsman shall have so far fallen from his hopeful youth that he
cannot pluck up an enthusiasm over anything but his ledger, I
venture to doubt whether he will be near so nice a fellow, and
whether he would welcome, with so good a grace, a couple of
drenched Englishmen paddling into Brussels in the dusk.</p>
<p>When we had changed our wet clothes and drunk a glass of pale
ale to the Club&rsquo;s prosperity, one of their number escorted
us to an hotel.&nbsp; He would not join us at our dinner, but he
had no objection to a glass of wine.&nbsp; Enthusiasm is very
wearing; and I begin to understand why prophets were unpopular in
Jud&aelig;a, where they were best known.&nbsp; For three stricken
hours did this excellent young man sit beside us to dilate on
boats and boat-races; and before he left, he was kind enough to
order our bedroom candles.</p>
<p>We endeavoured now and again to change the subject; but the
diversion did not last a moment: the Royal Nautical Sportsman
bridled, shied, answered the question, and then breasted once
more into the swelling tide of his subject.&nbsp; I call it his
subject; but I think it was he who was subjected.&nbsp; The
<i>Arethusa</i>, who holds all racing as a creature of the devil,
found himself in a pitiful dilemma.&nbsp; He durst not own his
ignorance for the honour of Old England, and spoke away about
English clubs and English oarsmen whose fame had never before
come to his ears.&nbsp; Several times, and, once above all, on
the question of sliding-seats, he was within an ace of
exposure.&nbsp; As for the <i>Cigarette</i>, who has rowed races
in the heat of his blood, but now disowns these slips of his
wanton youth, his case was still more desperate; for the Royal
Nautical proposed that he should take an oar in one of their
eights on the morrow, to compare the English with the Belgian
stroke.&nbsp; I could see my friend perspiring in his chair
whenever that particular topic came up.&nbsp; And there was yet
another proposal which had the same effect on both of us.&nbsp;
It appeared that the champion canoeist of Europe (as well as most
other champions) was a Royal Nautical Sportsman.&nbsp; And if we
would only wait until the Sunday, this infernal paddler would be
so condescending as to accompany us on our next stage.&nbsp;
Neither of us had the least desire to drive the coursers of the
sun against Apollo.</p>
<p>When the young man was gone, we countermanded our candles, and
ordered some brandy and water.&nbsp; The great billows had gone
over our head.&nbsp; The Royal Nautical Sportsmen were as nice
young fellows as a man would wish to see, but they were a trifle
too young and a thought too nautical for us.&nbsp; We began to
see that we were old and cynical; we liked ease and the agreeable
rambling of the human mind about this and the other subject; we
did not want to disgrace our native land by messing an eight, or
toiling pitifully in the wake of the champion canoeist.&nbsp; In
short, we had recourse to flight.&nbsp; It seemed ungrateful, but
we tried to make that good on a card loaded with sincere
compliments.&nbsp; And indeed it was no time for scruples; we
seemed to feel the hot breath of the champion on our necks.</p>
<h2><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>AT
MAUBEUGE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Partly</span> from the terror we had of
our good friends the Royal Nauticals, partly from the fact that
there were no fewer than fifty-five locks between Brussels and
Charleroi, we concluded that we should travel by train across the
frontier, boats and all.&nbsp; Fifty-five locks in a day&rsquo;s
journey was pretty well tantamount to trudging the whole distance
on foot, with the canoes upon our shoulders, an object of
astonishment to the trees on the canal side, and of honest
derision to all right-thinking children.</p>
<p>To pass the frontier, even in a train, is a difficult matter
for the <i>Arethusa</i>.&nbsp; He is somehow or other a marked
man for the official eye.&nbsp; Wherever he journeys, there are
the officers gathered together.&nbsp; Treaties are solemnly
signed, foreign ministers, ambassadors, and consuls sit throned
in state from China to Peru, and the Union Jack flutters on all
the winds of heaven.&nbsp; Under these safeguards, portly
clergymen, school-mistresses, gentlemen in grey tweed suits, and
all the ruck and rabble of British touristry pour unhindered,
<i>Murray</i> in hand, over the railways of the Continent, and
yet the slim person of the <i>Arethusa</i> is taken in the
meshes, while these great fish go on their way rejoicing.&nbsp;
If he travels without a passport, he is cast, without any figure
about the matter, into noisome dungeons: if his papers are in
order, he is suffered to go his way indeed, but not until he has
been humiliated by a general incredulity.&nbsp; He is a born
British subject, yet he has never succeeded in persuading a
single official of his nationality.&nbsp; He flatters himself he
is indifferent honest; yet he is rarely taken for anything better
than a spy, and there is no absurd and disreputable means of
livelihood but has been attributed to him in some heat of
official or popular distrust. . . .</p>
<p>For the life of me I cannot understand it.&nbsp; I too have
been knolled to church, and sat at good men&rsquo;s feasts; but I
bear no mark of it.&nbsp; I am as strange as a Jack Indian to
their official spectacles.&nbsp; I might come from any part of
the globe, it seems, except from where I do.&nbsp; My ancestors
have laboured in vain, and the glorious Constitution cannot
protect me in my walks abroad.&nbsp; It is a great thing, believe
me, to present a good normal type of the nation you belong
to.</p>
<p>Nobody else was asked for his papers on the way to Maubeuge;
but I was; and although I clung to my rights, I had to choose at
last between accepting the humiliation and being left behind by
the train.&nbsp; I was sorry to give way; but I wanted to get to
Maubeuge.</p>
<p>Maubeuge is a fortified town, with a very good inn, the
<i>Grand Cerf</i>.&nbsp; It seemed to be inhabited principally by
soldiers and bagmen; at least, these were all that we saw, except
the hotel servants.&nbsp; We had to stay there some time, for the
canoes were in no hurry to follow us, and at last stuck
hopelessly in the custom-house until we went back to liberate
them.&nbsp; There was nothing to do, nothing to see.&nbsp; We had
good meals, which was a great matter; but that was all.</p>
<p>The <i>Cigarette</i> was nearly taken up upon a charge of
drawing the fortifications: a feat of which he was hopelessly
incapable.&nbsp; And besides, as I suppose each belligerent
nation has a plan of the other&rsquo;s fortified places already,
these precautions are of the nature of shutting the stable door
after the steed is away.&nbsp; But I have no doubt they help to
keep up a good spirit at home.&nbsp; It is a great thing if you
can persuade people that they are somehow or other partakers in a
mystery.&nbsp; It makes them feel bigger.&nbsp; Even the
Freemasons, who have been shown up to satiety, preserve a kind of
pride; and not a grocer among them, however honest, harmless, and
empty-headed he may feel himself to be at bottom, but comes home
from one of their <i>coenacula</i> with a portentous significance
for himself.</p>
<p>It is an odd thing, how happily two people, if there are two,
can live in a place where they have no acquaintance.&nbsp; I
think the spectacle of a whole life in which you have no part
paralyses personal desire.&nbsp; You are content to become a mere
spectator.&nbsp; The baker stands in his door; the colonel with
his three medals goes by to the <i>caf&eacute;</i> at night; the
troops drum and trumpet and man the ramparts, as bold as so many
lions.&nbsp; It would task language to say how placidly you
behold all this.&nbsp; In a place where you have taken some root,
you are provoked out of your indifference; you have a hand in the
game; your friends are fighting with the army.&nbsp; But in a
strange town, not small enough to grow too soon familiar, nor so
large as to have laid itself out for travellers, you stand so far
apart from the business, that you positively forget it would be
possible to go nearer; you have so little human interest around
you, that you do not remember yourself to be a man.&nbsp;
Perhaps, in a very short time, you would be one no longer.&nbsp;
Gymnosophists go into a wood, with all nature seething around
them, with romance on every side; it would be much more to the
purpose if they took up their abode in a dull country town, where
they should see just so much of humanity as to keep them from
desiring more, and only the stale externals of man&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; These externals are as dead to us as so many
formalities, and speak a dead language in our eyes and
ears.&nbsp; They have no more meaning than an oath or a
salutation.&nbsp; We are so much accustomed to see married
couples going to church of a Sunday that we have clean forgotten
what they represent; and novelists are driven to rehabilitate
adultery, no less, when they wish to show us what a beautiful
thing it is for a man and a woman to live for each other.</p>
<p>One person in Maubeuge, however, showed me something more than
his outside.&nbsp; That was the driver of the hotel omnibus: a
mean enough looking little man, as well as I can remember; but
with a spark of something human in his soul.&nbsp; He had heard
of our little journey, and came to me at once in envious
sympathy.&nbsp; How he longed to travel! he told me.&nbsp; How he
longed to be somewhere else, and see the round world before he
went into the grave!&nbsp; &lsquo;Here I am,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I drive to the station.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; And
then I drive back again to the hotel.&nbsp; And so on every day
and all the week round.&nbsp; My God, is that life?&rsquo;&nbsp;
I could not say I thought it was&mdash;for him.&nbsp; He pressed
me to tell him where I had been, and where I hoped to go; and as
he listened, I declare the fellow sighed.&nbsp; Might not this
have been a brave African traveller, or gone to the Indies after
Drake?&nbsp; But it is an evil age for the gypsily inclined among
men.&nbsp; He who can sit squarest on a three-legged stool, he it
is who has the wealth and glory.</p>
<p>I wonder if my friend is still driving the omnibus for the
Grand Cerf?&nbsp; Not very likely, I believe; for I think he was
on the eve of mutiny when we passed through, and perhaps our
passage determined him for good.&nbsp; Better a thousand times
that he should be a tramp, and mend pots and pans by the wayside,
and sleep under trees, and see the dawn and the sunset every day
above a new horizon.&nbsp; I think I hear you say that it is a
respectable position to drive an omnibus?&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp;
What right has he who likes it not, to keep those who would like
it dearly out of this respectable position?&nbsp; Suppose a dish
were not to my taste, and you told me that it was a favourite
amongst the rest of the company, what should I conclude from
that?&nbsp; Not to finish the dish against my stomach, I
suppose.</p>
<p>Respectability is a very good thing in its way, but it does
not rise superior to all considerations.&nbsp; I would not for a
moment venture to hint that it was a matter of taste; but I think
I will go as far as this: that if a position is admittedly
unkind, uncomfortable, unnecessary, and superfluously useless,
although it were as respectable as the Church of England, the
sooner a man is out of it, the better for himself, and all
concerned.</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>ON THE
SAMBRE CANALISED: TO QUARTES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> three in the afternoon the
whole establishment of the <i>Grand Cerf</i> accompanied us to
the water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; The man of the omnibus was there
with haggard eyes.&nbsp; Poor cage-bird!&nbsp; Do I not remember
the time when I myself haunted the station, to watch train after
train carry its complement of freemen into the night, and read
the names of distant places on the time-bills with indescribable
longings?</p>
<p>We were not clear of the fortifications before the rain
began.&nbsp; The wind was contrary, and blew in furious gusts;
nor were the aspects of nature any more clement than the doings
of the sky.&nbsp; For we passed through a stretch of blighted
country, sparsely covered with brush, but handsomely enough
diversified with factory chimneys.&nbsp; We landed in a soiled
meadow among some pollards, and there smoked a pipe in a flaw of
fair weather.&nbsp; But the wind blew so hard, we could get
little else to smoke.&nbsp; There were no natural objects in the
neighbourhood, but some sordid workshops.&nbsp; A group of
children headed by a tall girl stood and watched us from a little
distance all the time we stayed.&nbsp; I heartily wonder what
they thought of us.</p>
<p>At Hautmont, the lock was almost impassable; the landing-place
being steep and high, and the launch at a long distance.&nbsp;
Near a dozen grimy workmen lent us a hand.&nbsp; They refused any
reward; and, what is much better, refused it handsomely, without
conveying any sense of insult.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a way we have
in our countryside,&rsquo; said they.&nbsp; And a very becoming
way it is.&nbsp; In Scotland, where also you will get services
for nothing, the good people reject your money as if you had been
trying to corrupt a voter.&nbsp; When people take the trouble to
do dignified acts, it is worth while to take a little more, and
allow the dignity to be common to all concerned.&nbsp; But in our
brave Saxon countries, where we plod threescore years and ten in
the mud, and the wind keeps singing in our ears from birth to
burial, we do our good and bad with a high hand and almost
offensively; and make even our alms a witness-bearing and an act
of war against the wrong.</p>
<p>After Hautmont, the sun came forth again and the wind went
down; and a little paddling took us beyond the ironworks and
through a delectable land.&nbsp; The river wound among low hills,
so that sometimes the sun was at our backs, and sometimes it
stood right ahead, and the river before us was one sheet of
intolerable glory.&nbsp; On either hand, meadows and orchards
bordered, with a margin of sedge and water flowers, upon the
river.&nbsp; The hedges were of great height, woven about the
trunks of hedgerow elms; and the fields, as they were often very
small, looked like a series of bowers along the stream.&nbsp;
There was never any prospect; sometimes a hill-top with its trees
would look over the nearest hedgerow, just to make a middle
distance for the sky; but that was all.&nbsp; The heaven was bare
of clouds.&nbsp; The atmosphere, after the rain, was of
enchanting purity.&nbsp; The river doubled among the hillocks, a
shining strip of mirror glass; and the dip of the paddles set the
flowers shaking along the brink.</p>
<p>In the meadows wandered black and white cattle fantastically
marked.&nbsp; One beast, with a white head and the rest of the
body glossy black, came to the edge to drink, and stood gravely
twitching his ears at me as I went by, like some sort of
preposterous clergyman in a play.&nbsp; A moment after I heard a
loud plunge, and, turning my head, saw the clergyman struggling
to shore.&nbsp; The bank had given way under his feet.</p>
<p>Besides the cattle, we saw no living things except a few birds
and a great many fishermen.&nbsp; These sat along the edges of
the meadows, sometimes with one rod, sometimes with as many as
half a score.&nbsp; They seemed stupefied with contentment; and
when we induced them to exchange a few words with us about the
weather, their voices sounded quiet and far away.&nbsp; There was
a strange diversity of opinion among them as to the kind of fish
for which they set their lures; although they were all agreed in
this, that the river was abundantly supplied.&nbsp; Where it was
plain that no two of them had ever caught the same kind of fish,
we could not help suspecting that perhaps not any one of them had
ever caught a fish at all.&nbsp; I hope, since the afternoon was
so lovely, that they were one and all rewarded; and that a silver
booty went home in every basket for the pot.&nbsp; Some of my
friends would cry shame on me for this; but I prefer a man, were
he only an angler, to the bravest pair of gills in all
God&rsquo;s waters.&nbsp; I do not affect fishes unless when
cooked in sauce; whereas an angler is an important piece of river
scenery, and hence deserves some recognition among
canoeists.&nbsp; He can always tell you where you are after a
mild fashion; and his quiet presence serves to accentuate the
solitude and stillness, and remind you of the glittering citizens
below your boat.</p>
<p>The Sambre turned so industriously to and fro among his little
hills, that it was past six before we drew near the lock at
Quartes.&nbsp; There were some children on the tow-path, with
whom the <i>Cigarette</i> fell into a chaffing talk as they ran
along beside us.&nbsp; It was in vain that I warned him.&nbsp; In
vain I told him, in English, that boys were the most dangerous
creatures; and if once you began with them, it was safe to end in
a shower of stones.&nbsp; For my own part, whenever anything was
addressed to me, I smiled gently and shook my head as though I
were an inoffensive person inadequately acquainted with
French.&nbsp; For indeed I have had such experience at home, that
I would sooner meet many wild animals than a troop of healthy
urchins.</p>
<p>But I was doing injustice to these peaceable young
Hainaulters.&nbsp; When the <i>Cigarette</i> went off to make
inquiries, I got out upon the bank to smoke a pipe and
superintend the boats, and became at once the centre of much
amiable curiosity.&nbsp; The children had been joined by this
time by a young woman and a mild lad who had lost an arm; and
this gave me more security.&nbsp; When I let slip my first word
or so in French, a little girl nodded her head with a comical
grown-up air.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, you see,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;he understands well enough now; he was just making
believe.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the little group laughed together very
good-naturedly.</p>
<p>They were much impressed when they heard we came from England;
and the little girl proffered the information that England was an
island &lsquo;and a far way from here&mdash;<i>bien loin
d&rsquo;ici</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, you may say that, a far way from here,&rsquo; said
the lad with one arm.</p>
<p>I was as nearly home-sick as ever I was in my life; they
seemed to make it such an incalculable distance to the place
where I first saw the day.&nbsp; They admired the canoes very
much.&nbsp; And I observed one piece of delicacy in these
children, which is worthy of record.&nbsp; They had been
deafening us for the last hundred yards with petitions for a
sail; ay, and they deafened us to the same tune next morning when
we came to start; but then, when the canoes were lying empty,
there was no word of any such petition.&nbsp; Delicacy? or
perhaps a bit of fear for the water in so crank a vessel?&nbsp; I
hate cynicism a great deal worse than I do the devil; unless
perhaps the two were the same thing?&nbsp; And yet &rsquo;tis a
good tonic; the cold tub and bath-towel of the sentiments; and
positively necessary to life in cases of advanced
sensibility.</p>
<p>From the boats they turned to my costume.&nbsp; They could not
make enough of my red sash; and my knife filled them with
awe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They make them like that in England,&rsquo; said the
boy with one arm.&nbsp; I was glad he did not know how badly we
make them in England now-a-days.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are for people
who go away to sea,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;and to defend
one&rsquo;s life against great fish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I felt I was becoming a more and more romantic figure to the
little group at every word.&nbsp; And so I suppose I was.&nbsp;
Even my pipe, although it was an ordinary French clay pretty well
&lsquo;trousered,&rsquo; as they call it, would have a rarity in
their eyes, as a thing coming from so far away.&nbsp; And if my
feathers were not very fine in themselves, they were all from
over seas.&nbsp; One thing in my outfit, however, tickled them
out of all politeness; and that was the bemired condition of my
canvas shoes.&nbsp; I suppose they were sure the mud at any rate
was a home product.&nbsp; The little girl (who was the genius of
the party) displayed her own sabots in competition; and I wish
you could have seen how gracefully and merrily she did it.</p>
<p>The young woman&rsquo;s milk-can, a great amphora of hammered
brass, stood some way off upon the sward.&nbsp; I was glad of an
opportunity to divert public attention from myself, and return
some of the compliments I had received.&nbsp; So I admired it
cordially both for form and colour, telling them, and very truly,
that it was as beautiful as gold.&nbsp; They were not
surprised.&nbsp; The things were plainly the boast of the
countryside.&nbsp; And the children expatiated on the costliness
of these amphor&aelig;, which sell sometimes as high as thirty
francs apiece; told me how they were carried on donkeys, one on
either side of the saddle, a brave caparison in themselves; and
how they were to be seen all over the district, and at the larger
farms in great number and of great size.</p>
<h2><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>PONT-SUR-SAMBRE</h2>
<h3>WE ARE PEDLARS</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Cigarette</i> returned with
good news.&nbsp; There were beds to be had some ten
minutes&rsquo; walk from where we were, at a place called
Pont.&nbsp; We stowed the canoes in a granary, and asked among
the children for a guide.&nbsp; The circle at once widened round
us, and our offers of reward were received in dispiriting
silence.&nbsp; We were plainly a pair of Bluebeards to the
children; they might speak to us in public places, and where they
had the advantage of numbers; but it was another thing to venture
off alone with two uncouth and legendary characters, who had
dropped from the clouds upon their hamlet this quiet afternoon,
sashed and be-knived, and with a flavour of great voyages.&nbsp;
The owner of the granary came to our assistance, singled out one
little fellow and threatened him with corporalities; or I suspect
we should have had to find the way for ourselves.&nbsp; As it
was, he was more frightened at the granary man than the
strangers, having perhaps had some experience of the
former.&nbsp; But I fancy his little heart must have been going
at a fine rate; for he kept trotting at a respectful distance in
front, and looking back at us with scared eyes.&nbsp; Not
otherwise may the children of the young world have guided Jove or
one of his Olympian compeers on an adventure.</p>
<p>A miry lane led us up from Quartes with its church and
bickering windmill.&nbsp; The hinds were trudging homewards from
the fields.&nbsp; A brisk little woman passed us by.&nbsp; She
was seated across a donkey between a pair of glittering
milk-cans; and, as she went, she kicked jauntily with her heels
upon the donkey&rsquo;s side, and scattered shrill remarks among
the wayfarers.&nbsp; It was notable that none of the tired men
took the trouble to reply.&nbsp; Our conductor soon led us out of
the lane and across country.&nbsp; The sun had gone down, but the
west in front of us was one lake of level gold.&nbsp; The path
wandered a while in the open, and then passed under a trellis
like a bower indefinitely prolonged.&nbsp; On either hand were
shadowy orchards; cottages lay low among the leaves, and sent
their smoke to heaven; every here and there, in an opening,
appeared the great gold face of the west.</p>
<p>I never saw the <i>Cigarette</i> in such an idyllic frame of
mind.&nbsp; He waxed positively lyrical in praise of country
scenes.&nbsp; I was little less exhilarated myself; the mild air
of the evening, the shadows, the rich lights and the silence,
made a symphonious accompaniment about our walk; and we both
determined to avoid towns for the future and sleep in
hamlets.</p>
<p>At last the path went between two houses, and turned the party
out into a wide muddy high-road, bordered, as far as the eye
could reach on either hand, by an unsightly village.&nbsp; The
houses stood well back, leaving a ribbon of waste land on either
side of the road, where there were stacks of firewood, carts,
barrows, rubbish-heaps, and a little doubtful grass.&nbsp; Away
on the left, a gaunt tower stood in the middle of the
street.&nbsp; What it had been in past ages, I know not: probably
a hold in time of war; but now-a-days it bore an illegible
dial-plate in its upper parts, and near the bottom an iron
letter-box.</p>
<p>The inn to which we had been recommended at Quartes was full,
or else the landlady did not like our looks.&nbsp; I ought to
say, that with our long, damp india-rubber bags, we presented
rather a doubtful type of civilisation: like rag-and-bone men,
the <i>Cigarette</i> imagined.&nbsp; &lsquo;These gentlemen are
pedlars?&mdash;<i>Ces messieurs sont des
marchands</i>?&rsquo;&mdash;asked the landlady.&nbsp; And then,
without waiting for an answer, which I suppose she thought
superfluous in so plain a case, recommended us to a butcher who
lived hard by the tower, and took in travellers to lodge.</p>
<p>Thither went we.&nbsp; But the butcher was flitting, and all
his beds were taken down.&nbsp; Or else he didn&rsquo;t like our
look.&nbsp; As a parting shot, we had &lsquo;These gentlemen are
pedlars?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It began to grow dark in earnest.&nbsp; We could no longer
distinguish the faces of the people who passed us by with an
inarticulate good-evening.&nbsp; And the householders of Pont
seemed very economical with their oil; for we saw not a single
window lighted in all that long village.&nbsp; I believe it is
the longest village in the world; but I daresay in our
predicament every pace counted three times over.&nbsp; We were
much cast down when we came to the last auberge; and looking in
at the dark door, asked timidly if we could sleep there for the
night.&nbsp; A female voice assented in no very friendly
tones.&nbsp; We clapped the bags down and found our way to
chairs.</p>
<p>The place was in total darkness, save a red glow in the chinks
and ventilators of the stove.&nbsp; But now the landlady lit a
lamp to see her new guests; I suppose the darkness was what saved
us another expulsion; for I cannot say she looked gratified at
our appearance.&nbsp; We were in a large bare apartment, adorned
with two allegorical prints of Music and Painting, and a copy of
the law against public drunkenness.&nbsp; On one side, there was
a bit of a bar, with some half-a-dozen bottles.&nbsp; Two
labourers sat waiting supper, in attitudes of extreme weariness;
a plain-looking lass bustled about with a sleepy child of two;
and the landlady began to derange the pots upon the stove, and
set some beefsteak to grill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These gentlemen are pedlars?&rsquo; she asked
sharply.&nbsp; And that was all the conversation
forthcoming.&nbsp; We began to think we might be pedlars after
all.&nbsp; I never knew a population with so narrow a range of
conjecture as the innkeepers of Pont-sur-Sambre.&nbsp; But
manners and bearing have not a wider currency than
bank-notes.&nbsp; You have only to get far enough out of your
beat, and all your accomplished airs will go for nothing.&nbsp;
These Hainaulters could see no difference between us and the
average pedlar.&nbsp; Indeed we had some grounds for reflection
while the steak was getting ready, to see how perfectly they
accepted us at their own valuation, and how our best politeness
and best efforts at entertainment seemed to fit quite suitably
with the character of packmen.&nbsp; At least it seemed a good
account of the profession in France, that even before such judges
we could not beat them at our own weapons.</p>
<p>At last we were called to table.&nbsp; The two hinds (and one
of them looked sadly worn and white in the face, as though sick
with over-work and under-feeding) supped off a single plate of
some sort of bread-berry, some potatoes in their jackets, a small
cup of coffee sweetened with sugar-candy, and one tumbler of
swipes.&nbsp; The landlady, her son, and the lass aforesaid, took
the same.&nbsp; Our meal was quite a banquet by comparison.&nbsp;
We had some beefsteak, not so tender as it might have been, some
of the potatoes, some cheese, an extra glass of the swipes, and
white sugar in our coffee.</p>
<p>You see what it is to be a gentleman&mdash;I beg your pardon,
what it is to be a pedlar.&nbsp; It had not before occurred to me
that a pedlar was a great man in a labourer&rsquo;s ale-house;
but now that I had to enact the part for an evening, I found that
so it was.&nbsp; He has in his hedge quarters somewhat the same
pre-eminency as the man who takes a private parlour in an
hotel.&nbsp; The more you look into it, the more infinite are the
class distinctions among men; and possibly, by a happy
dispensation, there is no one at all at the bottom of the scale;
no one but can find some superiority over somebody else, to keep
up his pride withal.</p>
<p>We were displeased enough with our fare.&nbsp; Particularly
the <i>Cigarette</i>, for I tried to make believe that I was
amused with the adventure, tough beefsteak and all.&nbsp;
According to the Lucretian maxim, our steak should have been
flavoured by the look of the other people&rsquo;s
bread-berry.&nbsp; But we did not find it so in practice.&nbsp;
You may have a head-knowledge that other people live more poorly
than yourself, but it is not agreeable&mdash;I was going to say,
it is against the etiquette of the universe&mdash;to sit at the
same table and pick your own superior diet from among their
crusts.&nbsp; I had not seen such a thing done since the greedy
boy at school with his birthday cake.&nbsp; It was odious enough
to witness, I could remember; and I had never thought to play the
part myself.&nbsp; But there again you see what it is to be a
pedlar.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the poorer classes in our country are
much more charitably disposed than their superiors in
wealth.&nbsp; And I fancy it must arise a great deal from the
comparative indistinction of the easy and the not so easy in
these ranks.&nbsp; A workman or a pedlar cannot shutter himself
off from his less comfortable neighbours.&nbsp; If he treats
himself to a luxury, he must do it in the face of a dozen who
cannot.&nbsp; And what should more directly lead to charitable
thoughts? . . . Thus the poor man, camping out in life, sees it
as it is, and knows that every mouthful he puts in his belly has
been wrenched out of the fingers of the hungry.</p>
<p>But at a certain stage of prosperity, as in a balloon ascent,
the fortunate person passes through a zone of clouds, and
sublunary matters are thenceforward hidden from his view.&nbsp;
He sees nothing but the heavenly bodies, all in admirable order,
and positively as good as new.&nbsp; He finds himself surrounded
in the most touching manner by the attentions of Providence, and
compares himself involuntarily with the lilies and the
skylarks.&nbsp; He does not precisely sing, of course; but then
he looks so unassuming in his open landau!&nbsp; If all the world
dined at one table, this philosophy would meet with some rude
knocks.</p>
<h3><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>THE
TRAVELLING MERCHANT</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> the lackeys in
Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s farce, when the true nobleman broke in on
their high life below stairs, we were destined to be confronted
with a real pedlar.&nbsp; To make the lesson still more poignant
for fallen gentlemen like us, he was a pedlar of infinitely more
consideration than the sort of scurvy fellows we were taken for:
like a lion among mice, or a ship of war bearing down upon two
cock-boats.&nbsp; Indeed, he did not deserve the name of pedlar
at all: he was a travelling merchant.</p>
<p>I suppose it was about half-past eight when this worthy,
Monsieur Hector Gilliard of Maubeuge, turned up at the ale-house
door in a tilt cart drawn by a donkey, and cried cheerily on the
inhabitants.&nbsp; He was a lean, nervous flibbertigibbet of a
man, with something the look of an actor, and something the look
of a horse-jockey.&nbsp; He had evidently prospered without any
of the favours of education; for he adhered with stern simplicity
to the masculine gender, and in the course of the evening passed
off some fancy futures in a very florid style of
architecture.&nbsp; With him came his wife, a comely young woman
with her hair tied in a yellow kerchief, and their son, a little
fellow of four, in a blouse and military
<i>k&eacute;pi</i>.&nbsp; It was notable that the child was many
degrees better dressed than either of the parents.&nbsp; We were
informed he was already at a boarding-school; but the holidays
having just commenced, he was off to spend them with his parents
on a cruise.&nbsp; An enchanting holiday occupation, was it not?
to travel all day with father and mother in the tilt cart full of
countless treasures; the green country rattling by on either
side, and the children in all the villages contemplating him with
envy and wonder?&nbsp; It is better fun, during the holidays, to
be the son of a travelling merchant, than son and heir to the
greatest cotton-spinner in creation.&nbsp; And as for being a
reigning prince&mdash;indeed I never saw one if it was not Master
Gilliard!</p>
<p>While M. Hector and the son of the house were putting up the
donkey, and getting all the valuables under lock and key, the
landlady warmed up the remains of our beefsteak, and fried the
cold potatoes in slices, and Madame Gilliard set herself to waken
the boy, who had come far that day, and was peevish and dazzled
by the light.&nbsp; He was no sooner awake than he began to
prepare himself for supper by eating galette, unripe pears, and
cold potatoes&mdash;with, so far as I could judge, positive
benefit to his appetite.</p>
<p>The landlady, fired with motherly emulation, awoke her own
little girl; and the two children were confronted.&nbsp; Master
Gilliard looked at her for a moment, very much as a dog looks at
his own reflection in a mirror before he turns away.&nbsp; He was
at that time absorbed in the galette.&nbsp; His mother seemed
crestfallen that he should display so little inclination towards
the other sex; and expressed her disappointment with some candour
and a very proper reference to the influence of years.</p>
<p>Sure enough a time will come when he will pay more attention
to the girls, and think a great deal less of his mother: let us
hope she will like it as well as she seemed to fancy.&nbsp; But
it is odd enough; the very women who profess most contempt for
mankind as a sex, seem to find even its ugliest particulars
rather lively and high-minded in their own sons.</p>
<p>The little girl looked longer and with more interest, probably
because she was in her own house, while he was a traveller and
accustomed to strange sights.&nbsp; And besides there was no
galette in the case with her.</p>
<p>All the time of supper, there was nothing spoken of but my
young lord.&nbsp; The two parents were both absurdly fond of
their child.&nbsp; Monsieur kept insisting on his sagacity: how
he knew all the children at school by name; and when this utterly
failed on trial, how he was cautious and exact to a strange
degree, and if asked anything, he would sit and think&mdash;and
think, and if he did not know it, &lsquo;my faith, he
wouldn&rsquo;t tell you at all&mdash;<i>foi</i>, <i>il ne vous le
dira pas</i>&rsquo;: which is certainly a very high degree of
caution.&nbsp; At intervals, M. Hector would appeal to his wife,
with his mouth full of beefsteak, as to the little fellow&rsquo;s
age at such or such a time when he had said or done something
memorable; and I noticed that Madame usually pooh-poohed these
inquiries.&nbsp; She herself was not boastful in her vein; but
she never had her fill of caressing the child; and she seemed to
take a gentle pleasure in recalling all that was fortunate in his
little existence.&nbsp; No schoolboy could have talked more of
the holidays which were just beginning and less of the black
school-time which must inevitably follow after.&nbsp; She showed,
with a pride perhaps partly mercantile in origin, his pockets
preposterously swollen with tops and whistles and string.&nbsp;
When she called at a house in the way of business, it appeared he
kept her company; and whenever a sale was made, received a sou
out of the profit.&nbsp; Indeed they spoiled him vastly, these
two good people.&nbsp; But they had an eye to his manners for all
that, and reproved him for some little faults in breeding, which
occurred from time to time during supper.</p>
<p>On the whole, I was not much hurt at being taken for a
pedlar.&nbsp; I might think that I ate with greater delicacy, or
that my mistakes in French belonged to a different order; but it
was plain that these distinctions would be thrown away upon the
landlady and the two labourers.&nbsp; In all essential things we
and the Gilliards cut very much the same figure in the ale-house
kitchen.&nbsp; M. Hector was more at home, indeed, and took a
higher tone with the world; but that was explicable on the ground
of his driving a donkey-cart, while we poor bodies tramped
afoot.&nbsp; I daresay, the rest of the company thought us dying
with envy, though in no ill sense, to be as far up in the
profession as the new arrival.</p>
<p>And of one thing I am sure: that every one thawed and became
more humanised and conversible as soon as these innocent people
appeared upon the scene.&nbsp; I would not very readily trust the
travelling merchant with any extravagant sum of money; but I am
sure his heart was in the right place.&nbsp; In this mixed world,
if you can find one or two sensible places in a man&mdash;above
all, if you should find a whole family living together on such
pleasant terms&mdash;you may surely be satisfied, and take the
rest for granted; or, what is a great deal better, boldly make up
your mind that you can do perfectly well without the rest; and
that ten thousand bad traits cannot make a single good one any
the less good.</p>
<p>It was getting late.&nbsp; M. Hector lit a stable lantern and
went off to his cart for some arrangements; and my young
gentleman proceeded to divest himself of the better part of his
raiment, and play gymnastics on his mother&rsquo;s lap, and
thence on to the floor, with accompaniment of laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you going to sleep alone?&rsquo; asked the servant
lass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s little fear of that,&rsquo; says Master
Gilliard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You sleep alone at school,&rsquo; objected his
mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, come, you must be a man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he protested that school was a different matter from the
holidays; that there were dormitories at school; and silenced the
discussion with kisses: his mother smiling, no one better pleased
than she.</p>
<p>There certainly was, as he phrased it, very little fear that
he should sleep alone; for there was but one bed for the
trio.&nbsp; We, on our part, had firmly protested against one
man&rsquo;s accommodation for two; and we had a double-bedded pen
in the loft of the house, furnished, beside the beds, with
exactly three hat-pegs and one table.&nbsp; There was not so much
as a glass of water.&nbsp; But the window would open, by good
fortune.</p>
<p>Some time before I fell asleep the loft was full of the sound
of mighty snoring: the Gilliards, and the labourers, and the
people of the inn, all at it, I suppose, with one consent.&nbsp;
The young moon outside shone very clearly over Pont-sur-Sambre,
and down upon the ale-house where all we pedlars were abed.</p>
<h2><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>ON THE
SAMBRE CANALISED: TO LANDRECIES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the morning, when we came
downstairs, the landlady pointed out to us two pails of water
behind the street-door.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Voil&agrave; de
l&rsquo;eau pour vous d&eacute;barbouiller</i>,&rsquo; says
she.&nbsp; And so there we made a shift to wash ourselves, while
Madame Gilliard brushed the family boots on the outer doorstep,
and M. Hector, whistling cheerily, arranged some small goods for
the day&rsquo;s campaign in a portable chest of drawers, which
formed a part of his baggage.&nbsp; Meanwhile the child was
letting off Waterloo crackers all over the floor.</p>
<p>I wonder, by-the-bye, what they call Waterloo crackers in
France; perhaps Austerlitz crackers.&nbsp; There is a great deal
in the point of view.&nbsp; Do you remember the Frenchman who,
travelling by way of Southampton, was put down in Waterloo
Station, and had to drive across Waterloo Bridge?&nbsp; He had a
mind to go home again, it seems.</p>
<p>Pont itself is on the river, but whereas it is ten
minutes&rsquo; walk from Quartes by dry land, it is six weary
kilometres by water.&nbsp; We left our bags at the inn, and
walked to our canoes through the wet orchards unencumbered.&nbsp;
Some of the children were there to see us off, but we were no
longer the mysterious beings of the night before.&nbsp; A
departure is much less romantic than an unexplained arrival in
the golden evening.&nbsp; Although we might be greatly taken at a
ghost&rsquo;s first appearance, we should behold him vanish with
comparative equanimity.</p>
<p>The good folk of the inn at Pont, when we called there for the
bags, were overcome with marvelling.&nbsp; At sight of these two
dainty little boats, with a fluttering Union Jack on each, and
all the varnish shining from the sponge, they began to perceive
that they had entertained angels unawares.&nbsp; The landlady
stood upon the bridge, probably lamenting she had charged so
little; the son ran to and fro, and called out the neighbours to
enjoy the sight; and we paddled away from quite a crowd of wrapt
observers.&nbsp; These gentlemen pedlars, indeed!&nbsp; Now you
see their quality too late.</p>
<p>The whole day was showery, with occasional drenching
plumps.&nbsp; We were soaked to the skin, then partially dried in
the sun, then soaked once more.&nbsp; But there were some calm
intervals, and one notably, when we were skirting the forest of
Mormal, a sinister name to the ear, but a place most gratifying
to sight and smell.&nbsp; It looked solemn along the river-side,
drooping its boughs into the water, and piling them up aloft into
a wall of leaves.&nbsp; What is a forest but a city of
nature&rsquo;s own, full of hardy and innocuous living things,
where there is nothing dead and nothing made with the hands, but
the citizens themselves are the houses and public
monuments?&nbsp; There is nothing so much alive, and yet so
quiet, as a woodland; and a pair of people, swinging past in
canoes, feel very small and bustling by comparison.</p>
<p>And surely of all smells in the world, the smell of many trees
is the sweetest and most fortifying.&nbsp; The sea has a rude,
pistolling sort of odour, that takes you in the nostrils like
snuff, and carries with it a fine sentiment of open water and
tall ships; but the smell of a forest, which comes nearest to
this in tonic quality, surpasses it by many degrees in the
quality of softness.&nbsp; Again, the smell of the sea has little
variety, but the smell of a forest is infinitely changeful; it
varies with the hour of the day, not in strength merely, but in
character; and the different sorts of trees, as you go from one
zone of the wood to another, seem to live among different kinds
of atmosphere.&nbsp; Usually the resin of the fir
predominates.&nbsp; But some woods are more coquettish in their
habits; and the breath of the forest of Mormal, as it came aboard
upon us that showery afternoon, was perfumed with nothing less
delicate than sweetbrier.</p>
<p>I wish our way had always lain among woods.&nbsp; Trees are
the most civil society.&nbsp; An old oak that has been growing
where he stands since before the Reformation, taller than many
spires, more stately than the greater part of mountains, and yet
a living thing, liable to sicknesses and death, like you and me:
is not that in itself a speaking lesson in history?&nbsp; But
acres on acres full of such patriarchs contiguously rooted, their
green tops billowing in the wind, their stalwart younglings
pushing up about their knees: a whole forest, healthy and
beautiful, giving colour to the light, giving perfume to the air:
what is this but the most imposing piece in nature&rsquo;s
repertory?&nbsp; Heine wished to lie like Merlin under the oaks
of Broceliande.&nbsp; I should not be satisfied with one tree;
but if the wood grew together like a banyan grove, I would be
buried under the tap-root of the whole; my parts should circulate
from oak to oak; and my consciousness should be diffused abroad
in all the forest, and give a common heart to that assembly of
green spires, so that it also might rejoice in its own loveliness
and dignity.&nbsp; I think I feel a thousand squirrels leaping
from bough to bough in my vast mausoleum; and the birds and the
winds merrily coursing over its uneven, leafy surface.</p>
<p>Alas! the forest of Mormal is only a little bit of a wood, and
it was but for a little way that we skirted by its
boundaries.&nbsp; And the rest of the time the rain kept coming
in squirts and the wind in squalls, until one&rsquo;s heart grew
weary of such fitful, scolding weather.&nbsp; It was odd how the
showers began when we had to carry the boats over a lock, and
must expose our legs.&nbsp; They always did.&nbsp; This is a sort
of thing that readily begets a personal feeling against
nature.&nbsp; There seems no reason why the shower should not
come five minutes before or five minutes after, unless you
suppose an intention to affront you.&nbsp; The <i>Cigarette</i>
had a mackintosh which put him more or less above these
contrarieties.&nbsp; But I had to bear the brunt uncovered.&nbsp;
I began to remember that nature was a woman.&nbsp; My companion,
in a rosier temper, listened with great satisfaction to my
Jeremiads, and ironically concurred.&nbsp; He instanced, as a
cognate matter, the action of the tides, &lsquo;which,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;was altogether designed for the confusion of
canoeists, except in so far as it was calculated to minister to a
barren vanity on the part of the moon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the last lock, some little way out of Landrecies, I refused
to go any farther; and sat in a drift of rain by the side of the
bank, to have a reviving pipe.&nbsp; A vivacious old man, whom I
take to have been the devil, drew near and questioned me about
our journey.&nbsp; In the fulness of my heart, I laid bare our
plans before him.&nbsp; He said it was the silliest enterprise
that ever he heard of.&nbsp; Why, did I not know, he asked me,
that it was nothing but locks, locks, locks, the whole way? not
to mention that, at this season of the year, we should find the
Oise quite dry?&nbsp; &lsquo;Get into a train, my little young
man,&rsquo; said he, I and go you away home to your
parents.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was so astounded at the man&rsquo;s
malice, that I could only stare at him in silence.&nbsp; A tree
would never have spoken to me like this.&nbsp; At last I got out
with some words.&nbsp; We had come from Antwerp already, I told
him, which was a good long way; and we should do the rest in
spite of him.&nbsp; Yes, I said, if there were no other reason, I
would do it now, just because he had dared to say we could
not.&nbsp; The pleasant old gentleman looked at me sneeringly,
made an allusion to my canoe, and marched of, waggling his
head.</p>
<p>I was still inwardly fuming, when up came a pair of young
fellows, who imagined I was the <i>Cigarette&rsquo;s</i> servant,
on a comparison, I suppose, of my bare jersey with the
other&rsquo;s mackintosh, and asked me many questions about my
place and my master&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; I said he was a good
enough fellow, but had this absurd voyage on the head.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O no, no,&rsquo; said one, &lsquo;you must not say that;
it is not absurd; it is very courageous of him.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
believe these were a couple of angels sent to give me heart
again.&nbsp; It was truly fortifying to reproduce all the old
man&rsquo;s insinuations, as if they were original to me in my
character of a malcontent footman, and have them brushed away
like so many flies by these admirable young men.</p>
<p>When I recounted this affair to the <i>Cigarette</i>,
&lsquo;They must have a curious idea of how English servants
behave,&rsquo; says he dryly, &lsquo;for you treated me like a
brute beast at the lock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was a good deal mortified; but my temper had suffered, it is
a fact.</p>
<h2><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>AT
LANDRECIES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Landrecies the rain still fell
and the wind still blew; but we found a double-bedded room with
plenty of furniture, real water-jugs with real water in them, and
dinner: a real dinner, not innocent of real wine.&nbsp; After
having been a pedlar for one night, and a butt for the elements
during the whole of the next day, these comfortable circumstances
fell on my heart like sunshine.&nbsp; There was an English
fruiterer at dinner, travelling with a Belgian fruiterer; in the
evening at the <i>caf&eacute;</i>, we watched our compatriot drop
a good deal of money at corks; and I don&rsquo;t know why, but
this pleased us.</p>
<p>It turned out we were to see more of Landrecies than we
expected; for the weather next day was simply bedlamite.&nbsp; It
is not the place one would have chosen for a day&rsquo;s rest;
for it consists almost entirely of fortifications.&nbsp; Within
the ramparts, a few blocks of houses, a long row of barracks, and
a church, figure, with what countenance they may, as the
town.&nbsp; There seems to be no trade; and a shopkeeper from
whom I bought a sixpenny flint-and-steel, was so much affected
that he filled my pockets with spare flints into the
bargain.&nbsp; The only public buildings that had any interest
for us were the hotel and the <i>caf&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; But we
visited the church.&nbsp; There lies Marshal Clarke.&nbsp; But as
neither of us had ever heard of that military hero, we bore the
associations of the spot with fortitude.</p>
<p>In all garrison towns, guard-calls, and
<i>r&eacute;veilles</i>, and such like, make a fine romantic
interlude in civic business.&nbsp; Bugles, and drums, and fifes,
are of themselves most excellent things in nature; and when they
carry the mind to marching armies, and the picturesque
vicissitudes of war, they stir up something proud in the
heart.&nbsp; But in a shadow of a town like Landrecies, with
little else moving, these points of war made a proportionate
commotion.&nbsp; Indeed, they were the only things to
remember.&nbsp; It was just the place to hear the round going by
at night in the darkness, with the solid tramp of men marching,
and the startling reverberations of the drum.&nbsp; It reminded
you, that even this place was a point in the great warfaring
system of Europe, and might on some future day be ringed about
with cannon smoke and thunder, and make itself a name among
strong towns.</p>
<p>The drum, at any rate, from its martial voice and notable
physiological effect, nay, even from its cumbrous and comical
shape, stands alone among the instruments of noise.&nbsp; And if
it be true, as I have heard it said, that drums are covered with
asses&rsquo; skin, what a picturesque irony is there in
that!&nbsp; As if this long-suffering animal&rsquo;s hide had not
been sufficiently belaboured during life, now by Lyonnese
costermongers, now by presumptuous Hebrew prophets, it must be
stripped from his poor hinder quarters after death, stretched on
a drum, and beaten night after night round the streets of every
garrison town in Europe.&nbsp; And up the heights of Alma and
Spicheren, and wherever death has his red flag a-flying, and
sounds his own potent tuck upon the cannons, there also must the
drummer-boy, hurrying with white face over fallen comrades,
batter and bemaul this slip of skin from the loins of peaceable
donkeys.</p>
<p>Generally a man is never more uselessly employed than when he
is at this trick of bastinadoing asses&rsquo; hide.&nbsp; We know
what effect it has in life, and how your dull ass will not mend
his pace with beating.&nbsp; But in this state of mummy and
melancholy survival of itself, when the hollow skin reverberates
to the drummer&rsquo;s wrist, and each dub-a-dub goes direct to a
man&rsquo;s heart, and puts madness there, and that disposition
of the pulses which we, in our big way of talking, nickname
Heroism:&mdash;is there not something in the nature of a revenge
upon the donkey&rsquo;s persecutors?&nbsp; Of old, he might say,
you drubbed me up hill and down dale, and I must endure; but now
that I am dead, those dull thwacks that were scarcely audible in
country lanes, have become stirring music in front of the
brigade; and for every blow that you lay on my old greatcoat, you
will see a comrade stumble and fall.</p>
<p>Not long after the drums had passed the <i>caf&eacute;</i>,
the <i>Cigarette</i> and the <i>Arethusa</i> began to grow
sleepy, and set out for the hotel, which was only a door or two
away.&nbsp; But although we had been somewhat indifferent to
Landrecies, Landrecies had not been indifferent to us.&nbsp; All
day, we learned, people had been running out between the squalls
to visit our two boats.&nbsp; Hundreds of persons, so said
report, although it fitted ill with our idea of the
town&mdash;hundreds of persons had inspected them where they lay
in a coal-shed.&nbsp; We were becoming lions in Landrecies, who
had been only pedlars the night before in Pont.</p>
<p>And now, when we left the <i>caf&eacute;</i>, we were pursued
and overtaken at the hotel door by no less a person than the
<i>Juge de Paix</i>: a functionary, as far as I can make out, of
the character of a Scots Sheriff-Substitute.&nbsp; He gave us his
card and invited us to sup with him on the spot, very neatly,
very gracefully, as Frenchmen can do these things.&nbsp; It was
for the credit of Landrecies, said he; and although we knew very
well how little credit we could do the place, we must have been
churlish fellows to refuse an invitation so politely
introduced.</p>
<p>The house of the Judge was close by; it was a well-appointed
bachelor&rsquo;s establishment, with a curious collection of old
brass warming-pans upon the walls.&nbsp; Some of these were most
elaborately carved.&nbsp; It seemed a picturesque idea for a
collector.&nbsp; You could not help thinking how many night-caps
had wagged over these warming-pans in past generations; what
jests may have been made, and kisses taken, while they were in
service; and how often they had been uselessly paraded in the bed
of death.&nbsp; If they could only speak, at what absurd,
indecorous, and tragical scenes had they not been present!</p>
<p>The wine was excellent.&nbsp; When we made the Judge our
compliments upon a bottle, &lsquo;I do not give it you as my
worst,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; I wonder when Englishmen will learn
these hospitable graces.&nbsp; They are worth learning; they set
off life, and make ordinary moments ornamental.</p>
<p>There were two other Landrecienses present.&nbsp; One was the
collector of something or other, I forget what; the other, we
were told, was the principal notary of the place.&nbsp; So it
happened that we all five more or less followed the law.&nbsp; At
this rate, the talk was pretty certain to become technical.&nbsp;
The <i>Cigarette</i> expounded the Poor Laws very
magisterially.&nbsp; And a little later I found myself laying
down the Scots Law of Illegitimacy, of which I am glad to say I
know nothing.&nbsp; The collector and the notary, who were both
married men, accused the Judge, who was a bachelor, of having
started the subject.&nbsp; He deprecated the charge, with a
conscious, pleased air, just like all the men I have ever seen,
be they French or English.&nbsp; How strange that we should all,
in our unguarded moments, rather like to be thought a bit of a
rogue with the women!</p>
<p>As the evening went on, the wine grew more to my taste; the
spirits proved better than the wine; the company was
genial.&nbsp; This was the highest water mark of popular favour
on the whole cruise.&nbsp; After all, being in a Judge&rsquo;s
house, was there not something semi-official in the
tribute?&nbsp; And so, remembering what a great country France
is, we did full justice to our entertainment.&nbsp; Landrecies
had been a long while asleep before we returned to the hotel; and
the sentries on the ramparts were already looking for
daybreak.</p>
<h2><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>SAMBRE
AND OISE CANAL: CANAL BOATS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day we made a late start in
the rain.&nbsp; The Judge politely escorted us to the end of the
lock under an umbrella.&nbsp; We had now brought ourselves to a
pitch of humility in the matter of weather, not often attained
except in the Scottish Highlands.&nbsp; A rag of blue sky or a
glimpse of sunshine set our hearts singing; and when the rain was
not heavy, we counted the day almost fair.</p>
<p>Long lines of barges lay one after another along the canal;
many of them looking mighty spruce and shipshape in their jerkin
of Archangel tar picked out with white and green.&nbsp; Some
carried gay iron railings, and quite a parterre of
flower-pots.&nbsp; Children played on the decks, as heedless of
the rain as if they had been brought up on Loch Carron side; men
fished over the gunwale, some of them under umbrellas; women did
their washing; and every barge boasted its mongrel cur by way of
watch-dog.&nbsp; Each one barked furiously at the canoes, running
alongside until he had got to the end of his own ship, and so
passing on the word to the dog aboard the next.&nbsp; We must
have seen something like a hundred of these embarkations in the
course of that day&rsquo;s paddle, ranged one after another like
the houses in a street; and from not one of them were we
disappointed of this accompaniment.&nbsp; It was like visiting a
menagerie, the <i>Cigarette</i> remarked.</p>
<p>These little cities by the canal side had a very odd effect
upon the mind.&nbsp; They seemed, with their flower-pots and
smoking chimneys, their washings and dinners, a rooted piece of
nature in the scene; and yet if only the canal below were to
open, one junk after another would hoist sail or harness horses
and swim away into all parts of France; and the impromptu hamlet
would separate, house by house, to the four winds.&nbsp; The
children who played together to-day by the Sambre and Oise Canal,
each at his own father&rsquo;s threshold, when and where might
they next meet?</p>
<p>For some time past the subject of barges had occupied a great
deal of our talk, and we had projected an old age on the canals
of Europe.&nbsp; It was to be the most leisurely of progresses,
now on a swift river at the tail of a steam-boat, now waiting
horses for days together on some inconsiderable junction.&nbsp;
We should be seen pottering on deck in all the dignity of years,
our white beards falling into our laps.&nbsp; We were ever to be
busied among paint-pots; so that there should be no white
fresher, and no green more emerald than ours, in all the navy of
the canals.&nbsp; There should be books in the cabin, and
tobacco-jars, and some old Burgundy as red as a November sunset
and as odorous as a violet in April.&nbsp; There should be a
flageolet, whence the <i>Cigarette</i>, with cunning touch,
should draw melting music under the stars; or perhaps, laying
that aside, upraise his voice&mdash;somewhat thinner than of
yore, and with here and there a quaver, or call it a natural
grace-note&mdash;in rich and solemn psalmody.</p>
<p>All this, simmering in my mind, set me wishing to go aboard
one of these ideal houses of lounging.&nbsp; I had plenty to
choose from, as I coasted one after another, and the dogs bayed
at me for a vagrant.&nbsp; At last I saw a nice old man and his
wife looking at me with some interest, so I gave them good-day
and pulled up alongside.&nbsp; I began with a remark upon their
dog, which had somewhat the look of a pointer; thence I slid into
a compliment on Madame&rsquo;s flowers, and thence into a word in
praise of their way of life.</p>
<p>If you ventured on such an experiment in England you would get
a slap in the face at once.&nbsp; The life would be shown to be a
vile one, not without a side shot at your better fortune.&nbsp;
Now, what I like so much in France is the clear unflinching
recognition by everybody of his own luck.&nbsp; They all know on
which side their bread is buttered, and take a pleasure in
showing it to others, which is surely the better part of
religion.&nbsp; And they scorn to make a poor mouth over their
poverty, which I take to be the better part of manliness.&nbsp; I
have heard a woman in quite a better position at home, with a
good bit of money in hand, refer to her own child with a horrid
whine as &lsquo;a poor man&rsquo;s child.&rsquo;&nbsp; I would
not say such a thing to the Duke of Westminster.&nbsp; And the
French are full of this spirit of independence.&nbsp; Perhaps it
is the result of republican institutions, as they call
them.&nbsp; Much more likely it is because there are so few
people really poor, that the whiners are not enough to keep each
other in countenance.</p>
<p>The people on the barge were delighted to hear that I admired
their state.&nbsp; They understood perfectly well, they told me,
how Monsieur envied them.&nbsp; Without doubt Monsieur was rich;
and in that case he might make a canal boat as pretty as a
villa&mdash;<i>joli comme un ch&acirc;teau</i>.&nbsp; And with
that they invited me on board their own water villa.&nbsp; They
apologised for their cabin; they had not been rich enough to make
it as it ought to be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fire should have been here, at this side,&rsquo;
explained the husband.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then one might have a
writing-table in the middle&mdash;books&mdash;and&rsquo;
(comprehensively) &lsquo;all.&nbsp; It would be quite
coquettish&mdash;<i>&ccedil;a serait tout-&agrave;-fait
coquet</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he looked about him as though the
improvements were already made.&nbsp; It was plainly not the
first time that he had thus beautified his cabin in imagination;
and when next he makes a bit, I should expect to see the
writing-table in the middle.</p>
<p>Madame had three birds in a cage.&nbsp; They were no great
thing, she explained.&nbsp; Fine birds were so dear.&nbsp; They
had sought to get a <i>Hollandais</i> last winter in Rouen
(Rouen? thought I; and is this whole mansion, with its dogs and
birds and smoking chimneys, so far a traveller as that? and as
homely an object among the cliffs and orchards of the Seine as on
the green plains of Sambre?)&mdash;they had sought to get a
<i>Hollandais</i> last winter in Rouen; but these cost fifteen
francs apiece&mdash;picture it&mdash;fifteen francs!</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Pour un tout petit oiseau</i>&mdash;For quite a
little bird,&rsquo; added the husband.</p>
<p>As I continued to admire, the apologetics died away, and the
good people began to brag of their barge, and their happy
condition in life, as if they had been Emperor and Empress of the
Indies.&nbsp; It was, in the Scots phrase, a good hearing, and
put me in good humour with the world.&nbsp; If people knew what
an inspiriting thing it is to hear a man boasting, so long as he
boasts of what he really has, I believe they would do it more
freely and with a better grace.</p>
<p>They began to ask about our voyage.&nbsp; You should have seen
how they sympathised.&nbsp; They seemed half ready to give up
their barge and follow us.&nbsp; But these <i>canaletti</i> are
only gypsies semi-domesticated.&nbsp; The semi-domestication came
out in rather a pretty form.&nbsp; Suddenly Madam&rsquo;s brow
darkened.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Cependant</i>,&rsquo; she began, and
then stopped; and then began again by asking me if I were
single?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And your friend who went by just now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He also was unmarried.</p>
<p>O then&mdash;all was well.&nbsp; She could not have wives left
alone at home; but since there were no wives in the question, we
were doing the best we could.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To see about one in the world,&rsquo; said the husband,
&lsquo;<i>il n&rsquo;y a que &ccedil;a</i>&mdash;there is nothing
else worth while.&nbsp; A man, look you, who sticks in his own
village like a bear,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;&mdash;very well,
he sees nothing.&nbsp; And then death is the end of all.&nbsp;
And he has seen nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Madame reminded her husband of an Englishman who had come up
this canal in a steamer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps Mr. Moens in the <i>Ytene</i>,&rsquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; assented the husband.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He had his wife and family with him, and servants.&nbsp;
He came ashore at all the locks and asked the name of the
villages, whether from boatmen or lock-keepers; and then he
wrote, wrote them down.&nbsp; Oh, he wrote enormously!&nbsp; I
suppose it was a wager.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A wager was a common enough explanation for our own exploits,
but it seemed an original reason for taking notes.</p>
<h2><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>THE
OISE IN FLOOD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> nine next morning the two
canoes were installed on a light country cart at &Eacute;treux:
and we were soon following them along the side of a pleasant
valley full of hop-gardens and poplars.&nbsp; Agreeable villages
lay here and there on the slope of the hill; notably, Tupigny,
with the hop-poles hanging their garlands in the very street, and
the houses clustered with grapes.&nbsp; There was a faint
enthusiasm on our passage; weavers put their heads to the
windows; children cried out in ecstasy at sight of the two
&lsquo;boaties&rsquo;&mdash;<i>barguettes</i>: and bloused
pedestrians, who were acquainted with our charioteer, jested with
him on the nature of his freight.</p>
<p>We had a shower or two, but light and flying.&nbsp; The air
was clean and sweet among all these green fields and green things
growing.&nbsp; There was not a touch of autumn in the
weather.&nbsp; And when, at Vadencourt, we launched from a little
lawn opposite a mill, the sun broke forth and set all the leaves
shining in the valley of the Oise.</p>
<p>The river was swollen with the long rains.&nbsp; From
Vadencourt all the way to Origny, it ran with ever-quickening
speed, taking fresh heart at each mile, and racing as though it
already smelt the sea.&nbsp; The water was yellow and turbulent,
swung with an angry eddy among half-submerged willows, and made
an angry clatter along stony shores.&nbsp; The course kept
turning and turning in a narrow and well-timbered valley.&nbsp;
Now the river would approach the side, and run griding along the
chalky base of the hill, and show us a few open colza-fields
among the trees.&nbsp; Now it would skirt the garden-walls of
houses, where we might catch a glimpse through a doorway, and see
a priest pacing in the chequered sunlight.&nbsp; Again, the
foliage closed so thickly in front, that there seemed to be no
issue; only a thicket of willows, overtopped by elms and poplars,
under which the river ran flush and fleet, and where a kingfisher
flew past like a piece of the blue sky.&nbsp; On these different
manifestations the sun poured its clear and catholic looks.&nbsp;
The shadows lay as solid on the swift surface of the stream as on
the stable meadows.&nbsp; The light sparkled golden in the
dancing poplar leaves, and brought the hills into communion with
our eyes.&nbsp; And all the while the river never stopped running
or took breath; and the reeds along the whole valley stood
shivering from top to toe.</p>
<p>There should be some myth (but if there is, I know it not)
founded on the shivering of the reeds.&nbsp; There are not many
things in nature more striking to man&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; It is
such an eloquent pantomime of terror; and to see such a number of
terrified creatures taking sanctuary in every nook along the
shore, is enough to infect a silly human with alarm.&nbsp;
Perhaps they are only a-cold, and no wonder, standing waist-deep
in the stream.&nbsp; Or perhaps they have never got accustomed to
the speed and fury of the river&rsquo;s flux, or the miracle of
its continuous body.&nbsp; Pan once played upon their
forefathers; and so, by the hands of his river, he still plays
upon these later generations down all the valley of the Oise; and
plays the same air, both sweet and shrill, to tell us of the
beauty and the terror of the world.</p>
<p>The canoe was like a leaf in the current.&nbsp; It took it up
and shook it, and carried it masterfully away, like a Centaur
carrying off a nymph.&nbsp; To keep some command on our direction
required hard and diligent plying of the paddle.&nbsp; The river
was in such a hurry for the sea!&nbsp; Every drop of water ran in
a panic, like as many people in a frightened crowd.&nbsp; But
what crowd was ever so numerous, or so single-minded?&nbsp; All
the objects of sight went by at a dance measure; the eyesight
raced with the racing river; the exigencies of every moment kept
the pegs screwed so tight, that our being quivered like a
well-tuned instrument; and the blood shook off its lethargy, and
trotted through all the highways and byways of the veins and
arteries, and in and out of the heart, as if circulation were but
a holiday journey, and not the daily moil of threescore years and
ten.&nbsp; The reeds might nod their heads in warning, and with
tremulous gestures tell how the river was as cruel as it was
strong and cold, and how death lurked in the eddy underneath the
willows.&nbsp; But the reeds had to stand where they were; and
those who stand still are always timid advisers.&nbsp; As for us,
we could have shouted aloud.&nbsp; If this lively and beautiful
river were, indeed, a thing of death&rsquo;s contrivance, the old
ashen rogue had famously outwitted himself with us.&nbsp; I was
living three to the minute.&nbsp; I was scoring points against
him every stroke of my paddle, every turn of the stream.&nbsp; I
have rarely had better profit of my life.</p>
<p>For I think we may look upon our little private war with death
somewhat in this light.&nbsp; If a man knows he will sooner or
later be robbed upon a journey, he will have a bottle of the best
in every inn, and look upon all his extravagances as so much
gained upon the thieves.&nbsp; And above all, where instead of
simply spending, he makes a profitable investment for some of his
money, when it will be out of risk of loss.&nbsp; So every bit of
brisk living, and above all when it is healthful, is just so much
gained upon the wholesale filcher, death.&nbsp; We shall have the
less in our pockets, the more in our stomach, when he cries stand
and deliver.&nbsp; A swift stream is a favourite artifice of his,
and one that brings him in a comfortable thing per annum; but
when he and I come to settle our accounts, I shall whistle in his
face for these hours upon the upper Oise.</p>
<p>Towards afternoon we got fairly drunken with the sunshine and
the exhilaration of the pace.&nbsp; We could no longer contain
ourselves and our content.&nbsp; The canoes were too small for
us; we must be out and stretch ourselves on shore.&nbsp; And so
in a green meadow we bestowed our limbs on the grass, and smoked
deifying tobacco and proclaimed the world excellent.&nbsp; It was
the last good hour of the day, and I dwell upon it with extreme
complacency.</p>
<p>On one side of the valley, high up on the chalky summit of the
hill, a ploughman with his team appeared and disappeared at
regular intervals.&nbsp; At each revelation he stood still for a
few seconds against the sky: for all the world (as the
<i>Cigarette</i> declared) like a toy Burns who should have just
ploughed up the Mountain Daisy.&nbsp; He was the only living
thing within view, unless we are to count the river.</p>
<p>On the other side of the valley a group of red roofs and a
belfry showed among the foliage.&nbsp; Thence some inspired
bell-ringer made the afternoon musical on a chime of bells.&nbsp;
There was something very sweet and taking in the air he played;
and we thought we had never heard bells speak so intelligibly, or
sing so melodiously, as these.&nbsp; It must have been to some
such measure that the spinners and the young maids sang,
&lsquo;Come away, Death,&rsquo; in the Shakespearian
Illyria.&nbsp; There is so often a threatening note, something
blatant and metallic, in the voice of bells, that I believe we
have fully more pain than pleasure from hearing them; but these,
as they sounded abroad, now high, now low, now with a plaintive
cadence that caught the ear like the burthen of a popular song,
were always moderate and tunable, and seemed to fall in with the
spirit of still, rustic places, like the noise of a waterfall or
the babble of a rookery in spring.&nbsp; I could have asked the
bell-ringer for his blessing, good, sedate old man, who swung the
rope so gently to the time of his meditations.&nbsp; I could have
blessed the priest or the heritors, or whoever may be concerned
with such affairs in France, who had left these sweet old bells
to gladden the afternoon, and not held meetings, and made
collections, and had their names repeatedly printed in the local
paper, to rig up a peal of brand-new, brazen, Birmingham-hearted
substitutes, who should bombard their sides to the provocation of
a brand-new bell-ringer, and fill the echoes of the valley with
terror and riot.</p>
<p>At last the bells ceased, and with their note the sun
withdrew.&nbsp; The piece was at an end; shadow and silence
possessed the valley of the Oise.&nbsp; We took to the paddle
with glad hearts, like people who have sat out a noble
performance and returned to work.&nbsp; The river was more
dangerous here; it ran swifter, the eddies were more sudden and
violent.&nbsp; All the way down we had had our fill of
difficulties.&nbsp; Sometimes it was a weir which could be shot,
sometimes one so shallow and full of stakes that we must withdraw
the boats from the water and carry them round.&nbsp; But the
chief sort of obstacle was a consequence of the late high
winds.&nbsp; Every two or three hundred yards a tree had fallen
across the river, and usually involved more than another in its
fall.</p>
<p>Often there was free water at the end, and we could steer
round the leafy promontory and hear the water sucking and
bubbling among the twigs.&nbsp; Often, again, when the tree
reached from bank to bank, there was room, by lying close, to
shoot through underneath, canoe and all.&nbsp; Sometimes it was
necessary to get out upon the trunk itself and pull the boats
across; and sometimes, when the stream was too impetuous for
this, there was nothing for it but to land and &lsquo;carry
over.&rsquo;&nbsp; This made a fine series of accidents in the
day&rsquo;s career, and kept us aware of ourselves.</p>
<p>Shortly after our re-embarkation, while I was leading by a
long way, and still full of a noble, exulting spirit in honour of
the sun, the swift pace, and the church bells, the river made one
of its leonine pounces round a corner, and I was aware of another
fallen tree within a stone-cast.&nbsp; I had my backboard down in
a trice, and aimed for a place where the trunk seemed high enough
above the water, and the branches not too thick to let me slip
below.&nbsp; When a man has just vowed eternal brotherhood with
the universe, he is not in a temper to take great determinations
coolly, and this, which might have been a very important
determination for me, had not been taken under a happy
star.&nbsp; The tree caught me about the chest, and while I was
yet struggling to make less of myself and get through, the river
took the matter out of my hands, and bereaved me of my
boat.&nbsp; The <i>Arethusa</i> swung round broadside on, leaned
over, ejected so much of me as still remained on board, and thus
disencumbered, whipped under the tree, righted, and went merrily
away down stream.</p>
<p>I do not know how long it was before I scrambled on to the
tree to which I was left clinging, but it was longer than I cared
about.&nbsp; My thoughts were of a grave and almost sombre
character, but I still clung to my paddle.&nbsp; The stream ran
away with my heels as fast as I could pull up my shoulders, and I
seemed, by the weight, to have all the water of the Oise in my
trousers-pockets.&nbsp; You can never know, till you try it, what
a dead pull a river makes against a man.&nbsp; Death himself had
me by the heels, for this was his last ambuscado, and he must now
join personally in the fray.&nbsp; And still I held to my
paddle.&nbsp; At last I dragged myself on to my stomach on the
trunk, and lay there a breathless sop, with a mingled sense of
humour and injustice.&nbsp; A poor figure I must have presented
to Burns upon the hill-top with his team.&nbsp; But there was the
paddle in my hand.&nbsp; On my tomb, if ever I have one, I mean
to get these words inscribed: &lsquo;He clung to his
paddle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Cigarette</i> had gone past a while before; for, as I
might have observed, if I had been a little less pleased with the
universe at the moment, there was a clear way round the tree-top
at the farther side.&nbsp; He had offered his services to haul me
out, but as I was then already on my elbows, I had declined, and
sent him down stream after the truant <i>Arethusa</i>.&nbsp; The
stream was too rapid for a man to mount with one canoe, let alone
two, upon his hands.&nbsp; So I crawled along the trunk to shore,
and proceeded down the meadows by the river-side.&nbsp; I was so
cold that my heart was sore.&nbsp; I had now an idea of my own
why the reeds so bitterly shivered.&nbsp; I could have given any
of them a lesson.&nbsp; The <i>Cigarette</i> remarked facetiously
that he thought I was &lsquo;taking exercise&rsquo; as I drew
near, until he made out for certain that I was only twittering
with cold.&nbsp; I had a rub down with a towel, and donned a dry
suit from the india-rubber bag.&nbsp; But I was not my own man
again for the rest of the voyage.&nbsp; I had a queasy sense that
I wore my last dry clothes upon my body.&nbsp; The struggle had
tired me; and perhaps, whether I knew it or not, I was a little
dashed in spirit.&nbsp; The devouring element in the universe had
leaped out against me, in this green valley quickened by a
running stream.&nbsp; The bells were all very pretty in their
way, but I had heard some of the hollow notes of Pan&rsquo;s
music.&nbsp; Would the wicked river drag me down by the heels,
indeed? and look so beautiful all the time?&nbsp; Nature&rsquo;s
good-humour was only skin-deep after all.</p>
<p>There was still a long way to go by the winding course of the
stream, and darkness had fallen, and a late bell was ringing in
Origny Sainte-Beno&icirc;te, when we arrived.</p>
<h2><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>ORIGNY
SAINTE-BENO&Icirc;TE</h2>
<h3>A BY-DAY</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day was Sunday, and the
church bells had little rest; indeed, I do not think I remember
anywhere else so great a choice of services as were here offered
to the devout.&nbsp; And while the bells made merry in the
sunshine, all the world with his dog was out shooting among the
beets and colza.</p>
<p>In the morning a hawker and his wife went down the street at a
foot-pace, singing to a very slow, lamentable music &lsquo;<i>O
France</i>, <i>mes amours</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; It brought everybody
to the door; and when our landlady called in the man to buy the
words, he had not a copy of them left.&nbsp; She was not the
first nor the second who had been taken with the song.&nbsp;
There is something very pathetic in the love of the French
people, since the war, for dismal patriotic music-making.&nbsp; I
have watched a forester from Alsace while some one was singing
&lsquo;<i>Les malheurs de la France</i>,&rsquo; at a baptismal
party in the neighbourhood of Fontainebleau.&nbsp; He arose from
the table and took his son aside, close by where I was
standing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Listen, listen,&rsquo; he said, bearing on
the boy&rsquo;s shoulder, &lsquo;and remember this, my
son.&rsquo;&nbsp; A little after he went out into the garden
suddenly, and I could hear him sobbing in the darkness.</p>
<p>The humiliation of their arms and the loss of Alsace and
Lorraine made a sore pull on the endurance of this sensitive
people; and their hearts are still hot, not so much against
Germany as against the Empire.&nbsp; In what other country will
you find a patriotic ditty bring all the world into the
street?&nbsp; But affliction heightens love; and we shall never
know we are Englishmen until we have lost India.&nbsp;
Independent America is still the cross of my existence; I cannot
think of Farmer George without abhorrence; and I never feel more
warmly to my own land than when I see the Stars and Stripes, and
remember what our empire might have been.</p>
<p>The hawker&rsquo;s little book, which I purchased, was a
curious mixture.&nbsp; Side by side with the flippant, rowdy
nonsense of the Paris music-halls, there were many pastoral
pieces, not without a touch of poetry, I thought, and instinct
with the brave independence of the poorer class in France.&nbsp;
There you might read how the wood-cutter gloried in his axe, and
the gardener scorned to be ashamed of his spade.&nbsp; It was not
very well written, this poetry of labour, but the pluck of the
sentiment redeemed what was weak or wordy in the
expression.&nbsp; The martial and the patriotic pieces, on the
other hand, were tearful, womanish productions one and all.&nbsp;
The poet had passed under the Caudine Forks; he sang for an army
visiting the tomb of its old renown, with arms reversed; and sang
not of victory, but of death.&nbsp; There was a number in the
hawker&rsquo;s collection called &lsquo;Conscrits
Fran&ccedil;ais,&rsquo; which may rank among the most dissuasive
war-lyrics on record.&nbsp; It would not be possible to fight at
all in such a spirit.&nbsp; The bravest conscript would turn pale
if such a ditty were struck up beside him on the morning of
battle; and whole regiments would pile their arms to its
tune.</p>
<p>If Fletcher of Saltoun is in the right about the influence of
national songs, you would say France was come to a poor
pass.&nbsp; But the thing will work its own cure, and a
sound-hearted and courageous people weary at length of snivelling
over their disasters.&nbsp; Already Paul D&eacute;roul&egrave;de
has written some manly military verses.&nbsp; There is not much
of the trumpet note in them, perhaps, to stir a man&rsquo;s heart
in his bosom; they lack the lyrical elation, and move slowly; but
they are written in a grave, honourable, stoical spirit, which
should carry soldiers far in a good cause.&nbsp; One feels as if
one would like to trust D&eacute;roul&egrave;de with
something.&nbsp; It will be happy if he can so far inoculate his
fellow-countrymen that they may be trusted with their own
future.&nbsp; And in the meantime, here is an antidote to
&lsquo;French Conscripts&rsquo; and much other doleful
versification.</p>
<p>We had left the boats over-night in the custody of one whom we
shall call Carnival.&nbsp; I did not properly catch his name, and
perhaps that was not unfortunate for him, as I am not in a
position to hand him down with honour to posterity.&nbsp; To this
person&rsquo;s premises we strolled in the course of the day, and
found quite a little deputation inspecting the canoes.&nbsp;
There was a stout gentleman with a knowledge of the river, which
he seemed eager to impart.&nbsp; There was a very elegant young
gentleman in a black coat, with a smattering of English, who led
the talk at once to the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race.&nbsp; And
then there were three handsome girls from fifteen to twenty; and
an old gentleman in a blouse, with no teeth to speak of, and a
strong country accent.&nbsp; Quite the pick of Origny, I should
suppose.</p>
<p>The <i>Cigarette</i> had some mysteries to perform with his
rigging in the coach-house; so I was left to do the parade
single-handed.&nbsp; I found myself very much of a hero whether I
would or not.&nbsp; The girls were full of little shudderings
over the dangers of our journey.&nbsp; And I thought it would be
ungallant not to take my cue from the ladies.&nbsp; My mishap of
yesterday, told in an off-hand way, produced a deep
sensation.&nbsp; It was Othello over again, with no less than
three Desdemonas and a sprinkling of sympathetic senators in the
background.&nbsp; Never were the canoes more flattered, or
flattered more adroitly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is like a violin,&rsquo; cried one of the girls in
an ecstasy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thank you for the word, mademoiselle,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;All the more since there are people who call out
to me that it is like a coffin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! but it is really like a violin.&nbsp; It is
finished like a violin,&rsquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And polished like a violin,&rsquo; added a senator.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One has only to stretch the cords,&rsquo; concluded
another, &lsquo;and then tum-tumty-tum&rsquo;&mdash;he imitated
the result with spirit.</p>
<p>Was not this a graceful little ovation?&nbsp; Where this
people finds the secret of its pretty speeches, I cannot imagine;
unless the secret should be no other than a sincere desire to
please? But then no disgrace is attached in France to saying a
thing neatly; whereas in England, to talk like a book is to give
in one&rsquo;s resignation to society.</p>
<p>The old gentleman in the blouse stole into the coach-house,
and somewhat irrelevantly informed the <i>Cigarette</i> that he
was the father of the three girls and four more: quite an exploit
for a Frenchman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very fortunate,&rsquo; answered the
<i>Cigarette</i> politely.</p>
<p>And the old gentleman, having apparently gained his point,
stole away again.</p>
<p>We all got very friendly together.&nbsp; The girls proposed to
start with us on the morrow, if you please!&nbsp; And, jesting
apart, every one was anxious to know the hour of our
departure.&nbsp; Now, when you are going to crawl into your canoe
from a bad launch, a crowd, however friendly, is undesirable; and
so we told them not before twelve, and mentally determined to be
off by ten at latest.</p>
<p>Towards evening, we went abroad again to post some
letters.&nbsp; It was cool and pleasant; the long village was
quite empty, except for one or two urchins who followed us as
they might have followed a menagerie; the hills and the tree-tops
looked in from all sides through the clear air; and the bells
were chiming for yet another service.</p>
<p>Suddenly we sighted the three girls standing, with a fourth
sister, in front of a shop on the wide selvage of the
roadway.&nbsp; We had been very merry with them a little while
ago, to be sure.&nbsp; But what was the etiquette of
Origny?&nbsp; Had it been a country road, of course we should
have spoken to them; but here, under the eyes of all the gossips,
ought we to do even as much as bow?&nbsp; I consulted the
<i>Cigarette</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>I looked.&nbsp; There were the four girls on the same spot;
but now four backs were turned to us, very upright and
conscious.&nbsp; Corporal Modesty had given the word of command,
and the well-disciplined picket had gone right-about-face like a
single person.&nbsp; They maintained this formation all the while
we were in sight; but we heard them tittering among themselves,
and the girl whom we had not met laughed with open mouth, and
even looked over her shoulder at the enemy.&nbsp; I wonder was it
altogether modesty after all? or in part a sort of country
provocation?</p>
<p>As we were returning to the inn, we beheld something floating
in the ample field of golden evening sky, above the chalk cliffs
and the trees that grow along their summit.&nbsp; It was too high
up, too large, and too steady for a kite; and as it was dark, it
could not be a star.&nbsp; For although a star were as black as
ink and as rugged as a walnut, so amply does the sun bathe heaven
with radiance, that it would sparkle like a point of light for
us.&nbsp; The village was dotted with people with their heads in
air; and the children were in a bustle all along the street and
far up the straight road that climbs the hill, where we could
still see them running in loose knots.&nbsp; It was a balloon, we
learned, which had left Saint Quentin at half-past five that
evening.&nbsp; Mighty composedly the majority of the grown people
took it.&nbsp; But we were English, and were soon running up the
hill with the best.&nbsp; Being travellers ourselves in a small
way, we would fain have seen these other travellers alight.</p>
<p>The spectacle was over by the time we gained the top of the
hill.&nbsp; All the gold had withered out of the sky, and the
balloon had disappeared.&nbsp; Whither? I ask myself; caught up
into the seventh heaven? or come safely to land somewhere in that
blue uneven distance, into which the roadway dipped and melted
before our eyes?&nbsp; Probably the aeronauts were already
warming themselves at a farm chimney, for they say it is cold in
these unhomely regions of the air.&nbsp; The night fell
swiftly.&nbsp; Roadside trees and disappointed sightseers,
returning through the meadows, stood out in black against a
margin of low red sunset.&nbsp; It was cheerfuller to face the
other way, and so down the hill we went, with a full moon, the
colour of a melon, swinging high above the wooded valley, and the
white cliffs behind us faintly reddened by the fire of the chalk
kilns.</p>
<p>The lamps were lighted, and the salads were being made in
Origny Sainte-Beno&icirc;te by the river.</p>
<h3><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>THE
COMPANY AT TABLE</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> we came late for dinner,
the company at table treated us to sparkling wine.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That is how we are in France,&rsquo; said one.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Those who sit down with us are our friends.&rsquo; And the
rest applauded.</p>
<p>They were three altogether, and an odd trio to pass the Sunday
with.</p>
<p>Two of them were guests like ourselves, both men of the
north.&nbsp; One ruddy, and of a full habit of body, with copious
black hair and beard, the intrepid hunter of France, who thought
nothing so small, not even a lark or a minnow, but he might
vindicate his prowess by its capture.&nbsp; For such a great,
healthy man, his hair flourishing like Samson&rsquo;s, his
arteries running buckets of red blood, to boast of these
infinitesimal exploits, produced a feeling of disproportion in
the world, as when a steam-hammer is set to cracking nuts.&nbsp;
The other was a quiet, subdued person, blond and lymphatic and
sad, with something the look of a Dane: &lsquo;<i>Tristes
t&ecirc;tes de Danois</i>!&rsquo; as Gaston Lafenestre used to
say.</p>
<p>I must not let that name go by without a word for the best of
all good fellows now gone down into the dust.&nbsp; We shall
never again see Gaston in his forest costume&mdash;he was Gaston
with all the world, in affection, not in disrespect&mdash;nor
hear him wake the echoes of Fontainebleau with the woodland
horn.&nbsp; Never again shall his kind smile put peace among all
races of artistic men, and make the Englishman at home in
France.&nbsp; Never more shall the sheep, who were not more
innocent at heart than he, sit all unconsciously for his
industrious pencil.&nbsp; He died too early, at the very moment
when he was beginning to put forth fresh sprouts, and blossom
into something worthy of himself; and yet none who knew him will
think he lived in vain.&nbsp; I never knew a man so little, for
whom yet I had so much affection; and I find it a good test of
others, how much they had learned to understand and value
him.&nbsp; His was indeed a good influence in life while he was
still among us; he had a fresh laugh, it did you good to see him;
and however sad he may have been at heart, he always bore a bold
and cheerful countenance, and took fortune&rsquo;s worst as it
were the showers of spring.&nbsp; But now his mother sits alone
by the side of Fontainebleau woods, where he gathered mushrooms
in his hardy and penurious youth.</p>
<p>Many of his pictures found their way across the Channel:
besides those which were stolen, when a dastardly Yankee left him
alone in London with two English pence, and perhaps twice as many
words of English.&nbsp; If any one who reads these lines should
have a scene of sheep, in the manner of Jacques, with this fine
creature&rsquo;s signature, let him tell himself that one of the
kindest and bravest of men has lent a hand to decorate his
lodging.&nbsp; There may be better pictures in the National
Gallery; but not a painter among the generations had a better
heart.&nbsp; Precious in the sight of the Lord of humanity, the
Psalms tell us, is the death of his saints.&nbsp; It had need to
be precious; for it is very costly, when by the stroke, a mother
is left desolate, and the peace-maker, and <i>peace-looker</i>,
of a whole society is laid in the ground with C&aelig;sar and the
Twelve Apostles.</p>
<p>There is something lacking among the oaks of Fontainebleau;
and when the dessert comes in at Barbizon, people look to the
door for a figure that is gone.</p>
<p>The third of our companions at Origny was no less a person
than the landlady&rsquo;s husband: not properly the landlord,
since he worked himself in a factory during the day, and came to
his own house at evening as a guest: a man worn to skin and bone
by perpetual excitement, with baldish head, sharp features, and
swift, shining eyes.&nbsp; On Saturday, describing some paltry
adventure at a duck-hunt, he broke a plate into a score of
fragments.&nbsp; Whenever he made a remark, he would look all
round the table with his chin raised, and a spark of green light
in either eye, seeking approval.&nbsp; His wife appeared now and
again in the doorway of the room, where she was superintending
dinner, with a &lsquo;Henri, you forget yourself,&rsquo; or a
&lsquo;Henri, you can surely talk without making such a
noise.&rsquo;&nbsp; Indeed, that was what the honest fellow could
not do.&nbsp; On the most trifling matter his eyes kindled, his
fist visited the table, and his voice rolled abroad in changeful
thunder.&nbsp; I never saw such a petard of a man; I think the
devil was in him.&nbsp; He had two favourite expressions:
&lsquo;it is logical,&rsquo; or illogical, as the case might be:
and this other, thrown out with a certain bravado, as a man might
unfurl a banner, at the beginning of many a long and sonorous
story: &lsquo;I am a proletarian, you see.&rsquo;&nbsp; Indeed,
we saw it very well.&nbsp; God forbid that ever I should find him
handling a gun in Paris streets!&nbsp; That will not be a good
moment for the general public.</p>
<p>I thought his two phrases very much represented the good and
evil of his class, and to some extent of his country.&nbsp; It is
a strong thing to say what one is, and not be ashamed of it; even
although it be in doubtful taste to repeat the statement too
often in one evening.&nbsp; I should not admire it in a duke, of
course; but as times go, the trait is honourable in a
workman.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is not at all a strong thing
to put one&rsquo;s reliance upon logic; and our own logic
particularly, for it is generally wrong.&nbsp; We never know
where we are to end, if once we begin following words or
doctors.&nbsp; There is an upright stock in a man&rsquo;s own
heart, that is trustier than any syllogism; and the eyes, and the
sympathies and appetites, know a thing or two that have never yet
been stated in controversy.&nbsp; Reasons are as plentiful as
blackberries; and, like fisticuffs, they serve impartially with
all sides.&nbsp; Doctrines do not stand or fall by their proofs,
and are only logical in so far as they are cleverly put.&nbsp; An
able controversialist no more than an able general demonstrates
the justice of his cause.&nbsp; But France is all gone wandering
after one or two big words; it will take some time before they
can be satisfied that they are no more than words, however big;
and when once that is done, they will perhaps find logic less
diverting.</p>
<p>The conversation opened with details of the day&rsquo;s
shooting.&nbsp; When all the sportsmen of a village shoot over
the village territory <i>pro indiviso</i>, it is plain that many
questions of etiquette and priority must arise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here now,&rsquo; cried the landlord, brandishing a
plate, &lsquo;here is a field of beet-root.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp;
Here am I then.&nbsp; I advance, do I not?&nbsp; <i>Eh bien</i>!
<i>sacristi</i>,&rsquo; and the statement, waxing louder, rolls
off into a reverberation of oaths, the speaker glaring about for
sympathy, and everybody nodding his head to him in the name of
peace.</p>
<p>The ruddy Northman told some tales of his own prowess in
keeping order: notably one of a Marquis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marquis,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;if you take another step
I fire upon you.&nbsp; You have committed a dirtiness,
Marquis.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon, it appeared, the Marquis touched his cap and
withdrew.</p>
<p>The landlord applauded noisily.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was well
done,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He did all that he
could.&nbsp; He admitted he was wrong.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then oath
upon oath.&nbsp; He was no marquis-lover either, but he had a
sense of justice in him, this proletarian host of ours.</p>
<p>From the matter of hunting, the talk veered into a general
comparison of Paris and the country.&nbsp; The proletarian beat
the table like a drum in praise of Paris.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is
Paris?&nbsp; Paris is the cream of France.&nbsp; There are no
Parisians: it is you and I and everybody who are Parisians.&nbsp;
A man has eighty chances per cent. to get on in the world in
Paris.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he drew a vivid sketch of the workman in
a den no bigger than a dog-hutch, making articles that were to go
all over the world.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Eh bien</i>, <i>quoi</i>,
<i>c&rsquo;est magnifique</i>, <i>ca</i>!&rsquo; cried he.</p>
<p>The sad Northman interfered in praise of a peasant&rsquo;s
life; he thought Paris bad for men and women;
&lsquo;<i>centralisation</i>,&rsquo; said he&mdash;</p>
<p>But the landlord was at his throat in a moment.&nbsp; It was
all logical, he showed him; and all magnificent.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What a spectacle!&nbsp; What a glance for an
eye!&rsquo;&nbsp; And the dishes reeled upon the table under a
cannonade of blows.</p>
<p>Seeking to make peace, I threw in a word in praise of the
liberty of opinion in France.&nbsp; I could hardly have shot more
amiss.&nbsp; There was an instant silence, and a great wagging of
significant heads.&nbsp; They did not fancy the subject, it was
plain; but they gave me to understand that the sad Northman was a
martyr on account of his views.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ask him a
bit,&rsquo; said they.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just ask him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said he in his quiet way, answering
me, although I had not spoken, &lsquo;I am afraid there is less
liberty of opinion in France than you may imagine.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And with that he dropped his eyes, and seemed to consider the
subject at an end.</p>
<p>Our curiosity was mightily excited at this.&nbsp; How, or why,
or when, was this lymphatic bagman martyred?&nbsp; We concluded
at once it was on some religious question, and brushed up our
memories of the Inquisition, which were principally drawn from
Poe&rsquo;s horrid story, and the sermon in <i>Tristram
Shandy</i>, I believe.</p>
<p>On the morrow we had an opportunity of going further into the
question; for when we rose very early to avoid a sympathising
deputation at our departure, we found the hero up before
us.&nbsp; He was breaking his fast on white wine and raw onions,
in order to keep up the character of martyr, I conclude.&nbsp; We
had a long conversation, and made out what we wanted in spite of
his reserve.&nbsp; But here was a truly curious
circumstance.&nbsp; It seems possible for two Scotsmen and a
Frenchman to discuss during a long half-hour, and each
nationality have a different idea in view throughout.&nbsp; It
was not till the very end that we discovered his heresy had been
political, or that he suspected our mistake.&nbsp; The terms and
spirit in which he spoke of his political beliefs were, in our
eyes, suited to religious beliefs.&nbsp; And <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more characteristic of the two
countries.&nbsp; Politics are the religion of France; as Nanty
Ewart would have said, &lsquo;A d-d bad religion&rsquo;; while
we, at home, keep most of our bitterness for little differences
about a hymn-book, or a Hebrew word which perhaps neither of the
parties can translate.&nbsp; And perhaps the misconception is
typical of many others that may never be cleared up: not only
between people of different race, but between those of different
sex.</p>
<p>As for our friend&rsquo;s martyrdom, he was a Communist, or
perhaps only a Communard, which is a very different thing; and
had lost one or more situations in consequence.&nbsp; I think he
had also been rejected in marriage; but perhaps he had a
sentimental way of considering business which deceived me.&nbsp;
He was a mild, gentle creature, anyway; and I hope he has got a
better situation, and married a more suitable wife since
then.</p>
<h2><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>DOWN
THE OISE: TO MOY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Carnival</span> notoriously cheated us at
first.&nbsp; Finding us easy in our ways, he regretted having let
us off so cheaply; and taking me aside, told me a cock-and-bull
story with the moral of another five francs for the
narrator.&nbsp; The thing was palpably absurd; but I paid up, and
at once dropped all friendliness of manner, and kept him in his
place as an inferior with freezing British dignity.&nbsp; He saw
in a moment that he had gone too far, and killed a willing horse;
his face fell; I am sure he would have refunded if he could only
have thought of a decent pretext.&nbsp; He wished me to drink
with him, but I would none of his drinks.&nbsp; He grew
pathetically tender in his professions; but I walked beside him
in silence or answered him in stately courtesies; and when we got
to the landing-place, passed the word in English slang to the
<i>Cigarette</i>.</p>
<p>In spite of the false scent we had thrown out the day before,
there must have been fifty people about the bridge.&nbsp; We were
as pleasant as we could be with all but Carnival.&nbsp; We said
good-bye, shaking hands with the old gentleman who knew the river
and the young gentleman who had a smattering of English; but
never a word for Carnival.&nbsp; Poor Carnival! here was a
humiliation.&nbsp; He who had been so much identified with the
canoes, who had given orders in our name, who had shown off the
boats and even the boatmen like a private exhibition of his own,
to be now so publicly shamed by the lions of his caravan!&nbsp; I
never saw anybody look more crestfallen than he.&nbsp; He hung in
the background, coming timidly forward ever and again as he
thought he saw some symptom of a relenting humour, and falling
hurriedly back when he encountered a cold stare.&nbsp; Let us
hope it will be a lesson to him.</p>
<p>I would not have mentioned Carnival&rsquo;s peccadillo had not
the thing been so uncommon in France.&nbsp; This, for instance,
was the only case of dishonesty or even sharp practice in our
whole voyage.&nbsp; We talk very much about our honesty in
England.&nbsp; It is a good rule to be on your guard wherever you
hear great professions about a very little piece of virtue.&nbsp;
If the English could only hear how they are spoken of abroad,
they might confine themselves for a while to remedying the fact;
and perhaps even when that was done, give us fewer of their
airs.</p>
<p>The young ladies, the graces of Origny, were not present at
our start, but when we got round to the second bridge, behold, it
was black with sightseers!&nbsp; We were loudly cheered, and for
a good way below, young lads and lasses ran along the bank still
cheering.&nbsp; What with current and paddling, we were flashing
along like swallows.&nbsp; It was no joke to keep up with us upon
the woody shore.&nbsp; But the girls picked up their skirts, as
if they were sure they had good ankles, and followed until their
breath was out.&nbsp; The last to weary were the three graces and
a couple of companions; and just as they too had had enough, the
foremost of the three leaped upon a tree-stump and kissed her
hand to the canoeists.&nbsp; Not Diana herself, although this was
more of a Venus after all, could have done a graceful thing more
gracefully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come back again!&rsquo; she cried; and
all the others echoed her; and the hills about Origny repeated
the words, &lsquo;Come back.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the river had us
round an angle in a twinkling, and we were alone with the green
trees and running water.</p>
<p>Come back?&nbsp; There is no coming back, young ladies, on the
impetuous stream of life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The merchant bows unto the seaman&rsquo;s
star,<br />
The ploughman from the sun his season takes.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we must all set our pocket-watches by the clock of
fate.&nbsp; There is a headlong, forthright tide, that bears away
man with his fancies like a straw, and runs fast in time and
space.&nbsp; It is full of curves like this, your winding river
of the Oise; and lingers and returns in pleasant pastorals; and
yet, rightly thought upon, never returns at all.&nbsp; For though
it should revisit the same acre of meadow in the same hour, it
will have made an ample sweep between-whiles; many little streams
will have fallen in; many exhalations risen towards the sun; and
even although it were the same acre, it will no more be the same
river of Oise.&nbsp; And thus, O graces of Origny, although the
wandering fortune of my life should carry me back again to where
you await death&rsquo;s whistle by the river, that will not be
the old I who walks the street; and those wives and mothers, say,
will those be you?</p>
<p>There was never any mistake about the Oise, as a matter of
fact.&nbsp; In these upper reaches it was still in a prodigious
hurry for the sea.&nbsp; It ran so fast and merrily, through all
the windings of its channel, that I strained my thumb, fighting
with the rapids, and had to paddle all the rest of the way with
one hand turned up.&nbsp; Sometimes it had to serve mills; and
being still a little river, ran very dry and shallow in the
meanwhile.&nbsp; We had to put our legs out of the boat, and
shove ourselves off the sand of the bottom with our feet.&nbsp;
And still it went on its way singing among the poplars, and
making a green valley in the world.&nbsp; After a good woman, and
a good book, and tobacco, there is nothing so agreeable on earth
as a river.&nbsp; I forgave it its attempt on my life; which was
after all one part owing to the unruly winds of heaven that had
blown down the tree, one part to my own mismanagement, and only a
third part to the river itself, and that not out of malice, but
from its great preoccupation over its business of getting to the
sea.&nbsp; A difficult business, too; for the d&eacute;tours it
had to make are not to be counted.&nbsp; The geographers seem to
have given up the attempt; for I found no map represent the
infinite contortion of its course.&nbsp; A fact will say more
than any of them.&nbsp; After we had been some hours, three if I
mistake not, flitting by the trees at this smooth, break-neck
gallop, when we came upon a hamlet and asked where we were, we
had got no farther than four kilometres (say two miles and a
half) from Origny.&nbsp; If it were not for the honour of the
thing (in the Scots saying), we might almost as well have been
standing still.</p>
<p>We lunched on a meadow inside a parallelogram of
poplars.&nbsp; The leaves danced and prattled in the wind all
round about us.&nbsp; The river hurried on meanwhile, and seemed
to chide at our delay.&nbsp; Little we cared.&nbsp; The river
knew where it was going; not so we: the less our hurry, where we
found good quarters and a pleasant theatre for a pipe.&nbsp; At
that hour, stockbrokers were shouting in Paris Bourse for two or
three per cent.; but we minded them as little as the sliding
stream, and sacrificed a hecatomb of minutes to the gods of
tobacco and digestion.&nbsp; Hurry is the resource of the
faithless.&nbsp; Where a man can trust his own heart, and those
of his friends, to-morrow is as good as to-day.&nbsp; And if he
die in the meanwhile, why then, there he dies, and the question
is solved.</p>
<p>We had to take to the canal in the course of the afternoon;
because, where it crossed the river, there was, not a bridge, but
a siphon.&nbsp; If it had not been for an excited fellow on the
bank, we should have paddled right into the siphon, and
thenceforward not paddled any more.&nbsp; We met a man, a
gentleman, on the tow-path, who was much interested in our
cruise.&nbsp; And I was witness to a strange seizure of lying
suffered by the <i>Cigarette</i>: who, because his knife came
from Norway, narrated all sorts of adventures in that country,
where he has never been.&nbsp; He was quite feverish at the end,
and pleaded demoniacal possession.</p>
<p>Moy (pronounce Mo&yuml;) was a pleasant little village,
gathered round a ch&acirc;teau in a moat.&nbsp; The air was
perfumed with hemp from neighbouring fields.&nbsp; At the Golden
Sheep we found excellent entertainment.&nbsp; German shells from
the siege of La F&egrave;re, N&uuml;rnberg figures, gold-fish in
a bowl, and all manner of knick-knacks, embellished the public
room.&nbsp; The landlady was a stout, plain, short-sighted,
motherly body, with something not far short of a genius for
cookery.&nbsp; She had a guess of her excellence herself.&nbsp;
After every dish was sent in, she would come and look on at the
dinner for a while, with puckered, blinking eyes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>C&rsquo;est bon</i>, <i>n&rsquo;est-ce pas</i>?&rsquo;
she would say; and when she had received a proper answer, she
disappeared into the kitchen.&nbsp; That common French dish,
partridge and cabbages, became a new thing in my eyes at the
Golden Sheep; and many subsequent dinners have bitterly
disappointed me in consequence.&nbsp; Sweet was our rest in the
Golden Sheep at Moy.</p>
<h2><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>LA
F&Egrave;RE OF CURSED MEMORY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> lingered in Moy a good part of
the day, for we were fond of being philosophical, and scorned
long journeys and early starts on principle.&nbsp; The place,
moreover, invited to repose.&nbsp; People in elaborate shooting
costumes sallied from the ch&acirc;teau with guns and game-bags;
and this was a pleasure in itself, to remain behind while these
elegant pleasure-seekers took the first of the morning.&nbsp; In
this way, all the world may be an aristocrat, and play the duke
among marquises, and the reigning monarch among dukes, if he will
only outvie them in tranquillity.&nbsp; An imperturbable
demeanour comes from perfect patience.&nbsp; Quiet minds cannot
be perplexed or frightened, but go on in fortune or misfortune at
their own private pace, like a clock during a thunderstorm.</p>
<p>We made a very short day of it to La F&egrave;re; but the dusk
was falling, and a small rain had begun before we stowed the
boats.&nbsp; La F&egrave;re is a fortified town in a plain, and
has two belts of rampart.&nbsp; Between the first and the second
extends a region of waste land and cultivated patches.&nbsp; Here
and there along the wayside were posters forbidding trespass in
the name of military engineering.&nbsp; At last, a second gateway
admitted us to the town itself.&nbsp; Lighted windows looked
gladsome, whiffs of comfortable cookery came abroad upon the
air.&nbsp; The town was full of the military reserve, out for the
French Autumn Man&oelig;uvres, and the reservists walked speedily
and wore their formidable great-coats.&nbsp; It was a fine night
to be within doors over dinner, and hear the rain upon the
windows.</p>
<p>The <i>Cigarette</i> and I could not sufficiently congratulate
each other on the prospect, for we had been told there was a
capital inn at La F&egrave;re.&nbsp; Such a dinner as we were
going to eat! such beds as we were to sleep in!&mdash;and all the
while the rain raining on houseless folk over all the poplared
countryside!&nbsp; It made our mouths water.&nbsp; The inn bore
the name of some woodland animal, stag, or hart, or hind, I
forget which.&nbsp; But I shall never forget how spacious and how
eminently habitable it looked as we drew near.&nbsp; The carriage
entry was lighted up, not by intention, but from the mere
superfluity of fire and candle in the house.&nbsp; A rattle of
many dishes came to our ears; we sighted a great field of
table-cloth; the kitchen glowed like a forge and smelt like a
garden of things to eat.</p>
<p>Into this, the inmost shrine and physiological heart of a
hostelry, with all its furnaces in action, and all its dressers
charged with viands, you are now to suppose us making our
triumphal entry, a pair of damp rag-and-bone men, each with a
limp india-rubber bag upon his arm.&nbsp; I do not believe I have
a sound view of that kitchen; I saw it through a sort of glory:
but it seemed to me crowded with the snowy caps of cookmen, who
all turned round from their saucepans and looked at us with
surprise.&nbsp; There was no doubt about the landlady, however:
there she was, heading her army, a flushed, angry woman, full of
affairs.&nbsp; Her I asked politely&mdash;too politely, thinks
the <i>Cigarette</i>&mdash;if we could have beds: she surveying
us coldly from head to foot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will find beds in the suburb,&rsquo; she
remarked.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are too busy for the like of
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If we could make an entrance, change our clothes, and order a
bottle of wine, I felt sure we could put things right; so said I:
&lsquo;If we cannot sleep, we may at least dine,&rsquo;&mdash;and
was for depositing my bag.</p>
<p>What a terrible convulsion of nature was that which followed
in the landlady&rsquo;s face!&nbsp; She made a run at us, and
stamped her foot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out with you&mdash;out of the door!&rsquo; she
screeched.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Sortez</i>! <i>sortez</i>! <i>sortez
par la porte</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I do not know how it happened, but next moment we were out in
the rain and darkness, and I was cursing before the carriage
entry like a disappointed mendicant.&nbsp; Where were the boating
men of Belgium? where the Judge and his good wines? and where the
graces of Origny?&nbsp; Black, black was the night after the
firelit kitchen; but what was that to the blackness in our
heart?&nbsp; This was not the first time that I have been refused
a lodging.&nbsp; Often and often have I planned what I should do
if such a misadventure happened to me again.&nbsp; And nothing is
easier to plan.&nbsp; But to put in execution, with the heart
boiling at the indignity?&nbsp; Try it; try it only once; and
tell me what you did.</p>
<p>It is all very fine to talk about tramps and morality.&nbsp;
Six hours of police surveillance (such as I have had), or one
brutal rejection from an inn-door, change your views upon the
subject like a course of lectures.&nbsp; As long as you keep in
the upper regions, with all the world bowing to you as you go,
social arrangements have a very handsome air; but once get under
the wheels, and you wish society were at the devil.&nbsp; I will
give most respectable men a fortnight of such a life, and then I
will offer them twopence for what remains of their morality.</p>
<p>For my part, when I was turned out of the Stag, or the Hind,
or whatever it was, I would have set the temple of Diana on fire,
if it had been handy.&nbsp; There was no crime complete enough to
express my disapproval of human institutions.&nbsp; As for the
<i>Cigarette</i>, I never knew a man so altered.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
have been taken for pedlars again,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Good God, what it must be to be a pedlar in
reality!&rsquo;&nbsp; He particularised a complaint for every
joint in the landlady&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; Timon was a
philanthropist alongside of him.&nbsp; And then, when he was at
the top of his maledictory bent, he would suddenly break away and
begin whimperingly to commiserate the poor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope
to God,&rsquo; he said,&mdash;and I trust the prayer was
answered,&mdash;&lsquo;that I shall never be uncivil to a
pedlar.&rsquo;&nbsp; Was this the imperturbable
<i>Cigarette</i>?&nbsp; This, this was he.&nbsp; O change beyond
report, thought, or belief!</p>
<p>Meantime the heaven wept upon our heads; and the windows grew
brighter as the night increased in darkness.&nbsp; We trudged in
and out of La F&egrave;re streets; we saw shops, and private
houses where people were copiously dining; we saw stables where
carters&rsquo; nags had plenty of fodder and clean straw; we saw
no end of reservists, who were very sorry for themselves this wet
night, I doubt not, and yearned for their country homes; but had
they not each man his place in La F&egrave;re barracks?&nbsp; And
we, what had we?</p>
<p>There seemed to be no other inn in the whole town.&nbsp;
People gave us directions, which we followed as best we could,
generally with the effect of bringing us out again upon the scene
of our disgrace.&nbsp; We were very sad people indeed by the time
we had gone all over La F&egrave;re; and the <i>Cigarette</i> had
already made up his mind to lie under a poplar and sup off a loaf
of bread.&nbsp; But right at the other end, the house next the
town-gate was full of light and bustle.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Bazin</i>, <i>aubergiste</i>, <i>loge &agrave;
pied</i>,&rsquo; was the sign.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>&Agrave; la Croix
de Malte</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; There were we received.</p>
<p>The room was full of noisy reservists drinking and smoking;
and we were very glad indeed when the drums and bugles began to
go about the streets, and one and all had to snatch shakoes and
be off for the barracks.</p>
<p>Bazin was a tall man, running to fat: soft-spoken, with a
delicate, gentle face.&nbsp; We asked him to share our wine; but
he excused himself, having pledged reservists all day long.&nbsp;
This was a very different type of the workman-innkeeper from the
bawling disputatious fellow at Origny.&nbsp; He also loved Paris,
where he had worked as a decorative painter in his youth.&nbsp;
There were such opportunities for self-instruction there, he
said.&nbsp; And if any one has read Zola&rsquo;s description of
the workman&rsquo;s marriage-party visiting the Louvre, they
would do well to have heard Bazin by way of antidote.&nbsp; He
had delighted in the museums in his youth.&nbsp; &lsquo;One sees
there little miracles of work,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;that is
what makes a good workman; it kindles a spark.&rsquo;&nbsp; We
asked him how he managed in La F&egrave;re.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
married,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I have my pretty
children.&nbsp; But frankly, it is no life at all.&nbsp; From
morning to night I pledge a pack of good enough fellows who know
nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It faired as the night went on, and the moon came out of the
clouds.&nbsp; We sat in front of the door, talking softly with
Bazin.&nbsp; At the guard-house opposite, the guard was being for
ever turned out, as trains of field artillery kept clanking in
out of the night, or patrols of horsemen trotted by in their
cloaks.&nbsp; Madame Bazin came out after a while; she was tired
with her day&rsquo;s work, I suppose; and she nestled up to her
husband and laid her head upon his breast.&nbsp; He had his arm
about her, and kept gently patting her on the shoulder.&nbsp; I
think Bazin was right, and he was really married.&nbsp; Of how
few people can the same be said!</p>
<p>Little did the Bazins know how much they served us.&nbsp; We
were charged for candles, for food and drink, and for the beds we
slept in.&nbsp; But there was nothing in the bill for the
husband&rsquo;s pleasant talk; nor for the pretty spectacle of
their married life.&nbsp; And there was yet another item
unchanged.&nbsp; For these people&rsquo;s politeness really set
us up again in our own esteem.&nbsp; We had a thirst for
consideration; the sense of insult was still hot in our spirits;
and civil usage seemed to restore us to our position in the
world.</p>
<p>How little we pay our way in life!&nbsp; Although we have our
purses continually in our hand, the better part of service goes
still unrewarded.&nbsp; But I like to fancy that a grateful
spirit gives as good as it gets.&nbsp; Perhaps the Bazins knew
how much I liked them? perhaps they also were healed of some
slights by the thanks that I gave them in my manner?</p>

THE OISE: THROUGH THE GOLDEN VALLEY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Below</span> La F&egrave;re the river runs
through a piece of open pastoral country; green, opulent, loved
by breeders; called the Golden Valley.&nbsp; In wide sweeps, and
with a swift and equable gallop, the ceaseless stream of water
visits and makes green the fields.&nbsp; Kine, and horses, and
little humorous donkeys, browse together in the meadows, and come
down in troops to the river-side to drink.&nbsp; They make a
strange feature in the landscape; above all when they are
startled, and you see them galloping to and fro with their
incongruous forms and faces.&nbsp; It gives a feeling as of
great, unfenced pampas, and the herds of wandering nations.&nbsp;
There were hills in the distance upon either hand; and on one
side, the river sometimes bordered on the wooded spurs of Coucy
and St. Gobain.</p>
<p>The artillery were practising at La F&egrave;re; and soon the
cannon of heaven joined in that loud play.&nbsp; Two continents
of cloud met and exchanged salvos overhead; while all round the
horizon we could see sunshine and clear air upon the hills.&nbsp;
What with the guns and the thunder, the herds were all frightened
in the Golden Valley.&nbsp; We could see them tossing their
heads, and running to and fro in timorous indecision; and when
they had made up their minds, and the donkey followed the horse,
and the cow was after the donkey, we could hear their hooves
thundering abroad over the meadows.&nbsp; It had a martial sound,
like cavalry charges.&nbsp; And altogether, as far as the ears
are concerned, we had a very rousing battle-piece performed for
our amusement.</p>
<p>At last the guns and the thunder dropped off; the sun shone on
the wet meadows; the air was scented with the breath of rejoicing
trees and grass; and the river kept unweariedly carrying us on at
its best pace.&nbsp; There was a manufacturing district about
Chauny; and after that the banks grew so high that they hid the
adjacent country, and we could see nothing but clay sides, and
one willow after another.&nbsp; Only, here and there, we passed
by a village or a ferry, and some wondering child upon the bank
would stare after us until we turned the corner.&nbsp; I daresay
we continued to paddle in that child&rsquo;s dreams for many a
night after.</p>
<p>Sun and shower alternated like day and night, making the hours
longer by their variety.&nbsp; When the showers were heavy, I
could feel each drop striking through my jersey to my warm skin;
and the accumulation of small shocks put me nearly beside
myself.&nbsp; I decided I should buy a mackintosh at Noyon.&nbsp;
It is nothing to get wet; but the misery of these individual
pricks of cold all over my body at the same instant of time made
me flail the water with my paddle like a madman.&nbsp; The
<i>Cigarette</i> was greatly amused by these ebullitions.&nbsp;
It gave him something else to look at besides clay banks and
willows.</p>
<p>All the time, the river stole away like a thief in straight
places, or swung round corners with an eddy; the willows nodded,
and were undermined all day long; the clay banks tumbled in; the
Oise, which had been so many centuries making the Golden Valley,
seemed to have changed its fancy, and be bent upon undoing its
performance.&nbsp; What a number of things a river does, by
simply following Gravity in the innocence of its heart!</p>
<h2><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>NOYON CATHEDRAL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Noyon</span> stands about a mile from the
river, in a little plain surrounded by wooded hills, and entirely
covers an eminence with its tile roofs, surmounted by a long,
straight-backed cathedral with two stiff towers.&nbsp; As we got
into the town, the tile roofs seemed to tumble uphill one upon
another, in the oddest disorder; but for all their scrambling,
they did not attain above the knees of the cathedral, which
stood, upright and solemn, over all.&nbsp; As the streets drew
near to this presiding genius, through the market-place under the
H&ocirc;tel de Ville, they grew emptier and more composed.&nbsp;
Blank walls and shuttered windows were turned to the great
edifice, and grass grew on the white causeway.&nbsp; &lsquo;Put
off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou
standest is holy ground.&rsquo;&nbsp; The H&ocirc;tel du Nord,
nevertheless, lights its secular tapers within a stone-cast of
the church; and we had the superb east-end before our eyes all
morning from the window of our bedroom.&nbsp; I have seldom
looked on the east-end of a church with more complete
sympathy.&nbsp; As it flanges out in three wide terraces and
settles down broadly on the earth, it looks like the poop of some
great old battle-ship.&nbsp; Hollow-backed buttresses carry
vases, which figure for the stern lanterns.&nbsp; There is a roll
in the ground, and the towers just appear above the pitch of the
roof, as though the good ship were bowing lazily over an Atlantic
swell.&nbsp; At any moment it might be a hundred feet away from
you, climbing the next billow.&nbsp; At any moment a window might
open, and some old admiral thrust forth a cocked hat, and proceed
to take an observation.&nbsp; The old admirals sail the sea no
longer; the old ships of battle are all broken up, and live only
in pictures; but this, that was a church before ever they were
thought upon, is still a church, and makes as brave an appearance
by the Oise.&nbsp; The cathedral and the river are probably the
two oldest things for miles around; and certainly they have both
a grand old age.</p>
<p>The Sacristan took us to the top of one of the towers, and
showed us the five bells hanging in their loft.&nbsp; From above,
the town was a tesselated pavement of roofs and gardens; the old
line of rampart was plainly traceable; and the Sacristan pointed
out to us, far across the plain, in a bit of gleaming sky between
two clouds, the towers of Ch&acirc;teau Coucy.</p>
<p>I find I never weary of great churches.&nbsp; It is my
favourite kind of mountain scenery.&nbsp; Mankind was never so
happily inspired as when it made a cathedral: a thing as single
and specious as a statue to the first glance, and yet, on
examination, as lively and interesting as a forest in
detail.&nbsp; The height of spires cannot be taken by
trigonometry; they measure absurdly short, but how tall they are
to the admiring eye!&nbsp; And where we have so many elegant
proportions, growing one out of the other, and all together into
one, it seems as if proportion transcended itself, and became
something different and more imposing.&nbsp; I could never fathom
how a man dares to lift up his voice to preach in a
cathedral.&nbsp; What is he to say that will not be an
anti-climax?&nbsp; For though I have heard a considerable variety
of sermons, I never yet heard one that was so expressive as a
cathedral.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the best preacher itself, and
preaches day and night; not only telling you of man&rsquo;s art
and aspirations in the past, but convicting your own soul of
ardent sympathies; or rather, like all good preachers, it sets
you preaching to yourself;&mdash;and every man is his own doctor
of divinity in the last resort.</p>
<p>As I sat outside of the hotel in the course of the afternoon,
the sweet groaning thunder of the organ floated out of the church
like a summons.&nbsp; I was not averse, liking the theatre so
well, to sit out an act or two of the play, but I could never
rightly make out the nature of the service I beheld.&nbsp; Four
or five priests and as many choristers were singing
<i>Miserere</i> before the high altar when I went in.&nbsp; There
was no congregation but a few old women on chairs and old men
kneeling on the pavement.&nbsp; After a while a long train of
young girls, walking two and two, each with a lighted taper in
her hand, and all dressed in black with a white veil, came from
behind the altar, and began to descend the nave; the four first
carrying a Virgin and child upon a table.&nbsp; The priests and
choristers arose from their knees and followed after, singing
&lsquo;Ave Mary&rsquo; as they went.&nbsp; In this order they
made the circuit of the cathedral, passing twice before me where
I leaned against a pillar.&nbsp; The priest who seemed of most
consequence was a strange, down-looking old man.&nbsp; He kept
mumbling prayers with his lips; but as he looked upon me
darkling, it did not seem as if prayer were uppermost in his
heart.&nbsp; Two others, who bore the burthen of the chaunt, were
stout, brutal, military-looking men of forty, with bold, over-fed
eyes; they sang with some lustiness, and trolled forth &lsquo;Ave
Mary&rsquo; like a garrison catch.&nbsp; The little girls were
timid and grave.&nbsp; As they footed slowly up the aisle, each
one took a moment&rsquo;s glance at the Englishman; and the big
nun who played marshal fairly stared him out of
countenance.&nbsp; As for the choristers, from first to last they
misbehaved as only boys can misbehave; and cruelly marred the
performance with their antics.</p>
<p>I understood a great deal of the spirit of what went on.&nbsp;
Indeed it would be difficult not to understand the
<i>Miserere</i>, which I take to be the composition of an
atheist.&nbsp; If it ever be a good thing to take such
despondency to heart, the <i>Miserere</i> is the right music, and
a cathedral a fit scene.&nbsp; So far I am at one with the
Catholics:&mdash;an odd name for them, after all?&nbsp; But why,
in God&rsquo;s name, these holiday choristers? why these priests
who steal wandering looks about the congregation while they feign
to be at prayer? why this fat nun, who rudely arranges her
procession and shakes delinquent virgins by the elbow? why this
spitting, and snuffing, and forgetting of keys, and the thousand
and one little misadventures that disturb a frame of mind
laboriously edified with chaunts and organings?&nbsp; In any
play-house reverend fathers may see what can be done with a
little art, and how, to move high sentiments, it is necessary to
drill the supernumeraries and have every stool in its proper
place.</p>
<p>One other circumstance distressed me.&nbsp; I could bear a
<i>Miserere</i> myself, having had a good deal of open-air
exercise of late; but I wished the old people somewhere
else.&nbsp; It was neither the right sort of music nor the right
sort of divinity for men and women who have come through most
accidents by this time, and probably have an opinion of their own
upon the tragic element in life.&nbsp; A person up in years can
generally do his own <i>Miserere</i> for himself; although I
notice that such an one often prefers <i>Jubilate Deo</i> for his
ordinary singing.&nbsp; On the whole, the most religious exercise
for the aged is probably to recall their own experience; so many
friends dead, so many hopes disappointed, so many slips and
stumbles, and withal so many bright days and smiling providences;
there is surely the matter of a very eloquent sermon in all
this.</p>
<p>On the whole, I was greatly solemnised.&nbsp; In the little
pictorial map of our whole Inland Voyage, which my fancy still
preserves, and sometimes unrolls for the amusement of odd
moments, Noyon cathedral figures on a most preposterous scale,
and must be nearly as large as a department.&nbsp; I can still
see the faces of the priests as if they were at my elbow, and
hear <i>Ave Maria</i>, <i>ora pro nobis</i>, sounding through the
church.&nbsp; All Noyon is blotted out for me by these superior
memories; and I do not care to say more about the place.&nbsp; It
was but a stack of brown roofs at the best, where I believe
people live very reputably in a quiet way; but the shadow of the
church falls upon it when the sun is low, and the five bells are
heard in all quarters, telling that the organ has begun.&nbsp; If
ever I join the Church of Rome, I shall stipulate to be Bishop of
Noyon on the Oise.</p>
<h2><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>DOWN
THE OISE: TO COMPI&Egrave;GNE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most patient people grow weary
at last with being continually wetted with rain; except of course
in the Scottish Highlands, where there are not enough fine
intervals to point the difference.&nbsp; That was like to be our
case, the day we left Noyon.&nbsp; I remember nothing of the
voyage; it was nothing but clay banks and willows, and rain;
incessant, pitiless, beating rain; until we stopped to lunch at a
little inn at Pimprez, where the canal ran very near the
river.&nbsp; We were so sadly drenched that the landlady lit a
few sticks in the chimney for our comfort; there we sat in a
steam of vapour, lamenting our concerns.&nbsp; The husband donned
a game-bag and strode out to shoot; the wife sat in a far corner
watching us.&nbsp; I think we were worth looking at.&nbsp; We
grumbled over the misfortune of La F&egrave;re; we forecast other
La F&egrave;res in the future;&mdash;although things went better
with the <i>Cigarette</i> for spokesman; he had more aplomb
altogether than I; and a dull, positive way of approaching a
landlady that carried off the india-rubber bags.&nbsp; Talking of
La F&egrave;re put us talking of the reservists.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Reservery,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;seems a pretty mean
way to spend ones autumn holiday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About as mean,&rsquo; returned I dejectedly, &lsquo;as
canoeing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These gentlemen travel for their pleasure?&rsquo; asked
the landlady, with unconscious irony.</p>
<p>It was too much.&nbsp; The scales fell from our eyes.&nbsp;
Another wet day, it was determined, and we put the boats into the
train.</p>
<p>The weather took the hint.&nbsp; That was our last
wetting.&nbsp; The afternoon faired up: grand clouds still
voyaged in the sky, but now singly, and with a depth of blue
around their path; and a sunset in the daintiest rose and gold
inaugurated a thick night of stars and a month of unbroken
weather.&nbsp; At the same time, the river began to give us a
better outlook into the country.&nbsp; The banks were not so
high, the willows disappeared from along the margin, and pleasant
hills stood all along its course and marked their profile on the
sky.</p>
<p>In a little while the canal, coming to its last lock, began to
discharge its water-houses on the Oise; so that we had no lack of
company to fear.&nbsp; Here were all our old friends; the <i>Deo
Gratias</i> of Cond&eacute; and the <i>Four Sons of Aymon</i>
journeyed cheerily down stream along with us; we exchanged
waterside pleasantries with the steersman perched among the
lumber, or the driver hoarse with bawling to his horses; and the
children came and looked over the side as we paddled by.&nbsp; We
had never known all this while how much we missed them; but it
gave us a fillip to see the smoke from their chimneys.</p>
<p>A little below this junction we made another meeting of yet
more account.&nbsp; For there we were joined by the Aisne,
already a far-travelled river and fresh out of Champagne.&nbsp;
Here ended the adolescence of the Oise; this was his marriage
day; thenceforward he had a stately, brimming march, conscious of
his own dignity and sundry dams.&nbsp; He became a tranquil
feature in the scene.&nbsp; The trees and towns saw themselves in
him, as in a mirror.&nbsp; He carried the canoes lightly on his
broad breast; there was no need to work hard against an eddy: but
idleness became the order of the day, and mere straightforward
dipping of the paddle, now on this side, now on that, without
intelligence or effort.&nbsp; Truly we were coming into halcyon
weather upon all accounts, and were floated towards the sea like
gentlemen.</p>
<p>We made Compi&egrave;gne as the sun was going down: a fine
profile of a town above the river.&nbsp; Over the bridge, a
regiment was parading to the drum.&nbsp; People loitered on the
quay, some fishing, some looking idly at the stream.&nbsp; And as
the two boats shot in along the water, we could see them pointing
them out and speaking one to another.&nbsp; We landed at a
floating lavatory, where the washerwomen were still beating the
clothes.</p>
<h2><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>AT
COMPI&Egrave;GNE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> put up at a big, bustling hotel
in Compi&egrave;gne, where nobody observed our presence.</p>
<p>Reservery and general <i>militarismus</i> (as the Germans call
it) were rampant.&nbsp; A camp of conical white tents without the
town looked like a leaf out of a picture Bible; sword-belts
decorated the walls of the <i>caf&eacute;s</i>; and the streets
kept sounding all day long with military music.&nbsp; It was not
possible to be an Englishman and avoid a feeling of elation; for
the men who followed the drums were small, and walked
shabbily.&nbsp; Each man inclined at his own angle, and jolted to
his own convenience, as he went.&nbsp; There was nothing of the
superb gait with which a regiment of tall Highlanders moves
behind its music, solemn and inevitable, like a natural
phenomenon.&nbsp; Who that has seen it can forget the drum-major
pacing in front, the drummers&rsquo; tiger-skins, the
pipers&rsquo; swinging plaids, the strange elastic rhythm of the
whole regiment footing it in time&mdash;and the bang of the drum,
when the brasses cease, and the shrill pipes take up the martial
story in their place?</p>
<p>A girl, at school in France, began to describe one of our
regiments on parade to her French schoolmates; and as she went
on, she told me, the recollection grew so vivid, she became so
proud to be the countrywoman of such soldiers, and so sorry to be
in another country, that her voice failed her and she burst into
tears.&nbsp; I have never forgotten that girl; and I think she
very nearly deserves a statue.&nbsp; To call her a young lady,
with all its niminy associations, would be to offer her an
insult.&nbsp; She may rest assured of one thing: although she
never should marry a heroic general, never see any great or
immediate result of her life, she will not have lived in vain for
her native land.</p>
<p>But though French soldiers show to ill advantage on parade, on
the march they are gay, alert, and willing like a troop of
fox-hunters.&nbsp; I remember once seeing a company pass through
the forest of Fontainebleau, on the Chailly road, between the Bas
Br&eacute;au and the Reine Blanche.&nbsp; One fellow walked a
little before the rest, and sang a loud, audacious marching
song.&nbsp; The rest bestirred their feet, and even swung their
muskets in time.&nbsp; A young officer on horseback had hard ado
to keep his countenance at the words.&nbsp; You never saw
anything so cheerful and spontaneous as their gait; schoolboys do
not look more eagerly at hare and hounds; and you would have
thought it impossible to tire such willing marchers.</p>
<p>My great delight in Compi&egrave;gne was the town-hall.&nbsp;
I doted upon the town-hall.&nbsp; It is a monument of Gothic
insecurity, all turreted, and gargoyled, and slashed, and
bedizened with half a score of architectural fancies.&nbsp; Some
of the niches are gilt and painted; and in a great square panel
in the centre, in black relief on a gilt ground, Louis XII. rides
upon a pacing horse, with hand on hip and head thrown back.&nbsp;
There is royal arrogance in every line of him; the stirruped foot
projects insolently from the frame; the eye is hard and proud;
the very horse seems to be treading with gratification over
prostrate serfs, and to have the breath of the trumpet in his
nostrils.&nbsp; So rides for ever, on the front of the town-hall,
the good king Louis XII., the father of his people.</p>
<p>Over the king&rsquo;s head, in the tall centre turret, appears
the dial of a clock; and high above that, three little mechanical
figures, each one with a hammer in his hand, whose business it is
to chime out the hours and halves and quarters for the burgesses
of Compi&egrave;gne.&nbsp; The centre figure has a gilt
breast-plate; the two others wear gilt trunk-hose; and they all
three have elegant, flapping hats like cavaliers.&nbsp; As the
quarter approaches, they turn their heads and look knowingly one
to the other; and then, <i>kling</i> go the three hammers on
three little bells below.&nbsp; The hour follows, deep and
sonorous, from the interior of the tower; and the gilded
gentlemen rest from their labours with contentment.</p>
<p>I had a great deal of healthy pleasure from their
man&oelig;uvres, and took good care to miss as few performances
as possible; and I found that even the <i>Cigarette</i>, while he
pretended to despise my enthusiasm, was more or less a devotee
himself.&nbsp; There is something highly absurd in the exposition
of such toys to the outrages of winter on a housetop.&nbsp; They
would be more in keeping in a glass case before a N&uuml;rnberg
clock.&nbsp; Above all, at night, when the children are abed, and
even grown people are snoring under quilts, does it not seem
impertinent to leave these ginger-bread figures winking and
tinkling to the stars and the rolling moon?&nbsp; The gargoyles
may fitly enough twist their ape-like heads; fitly enough may the
potentate bestride his charger, like a centurion in an old German
print of the <i>Via Dolorosa</i>; but the toys should be put away
in a box among some cotton, until the sun rises, and the children
are abroad again to be amused.</p>
<p>In Compi&egrave;gne post-office a great packet of letters
awaited us; and the authorities were, for this occasion only, so
polite as to hand them over upon application.</p>
<p>In some ways, our journey may be said to end with this
letter-bag at Compi&egrave;gne.&nbsp; The spell was broken.&nbsp;
We had partly come home from that moment.</p>
<p>No one should have any correspondence on a journey; it is bad
enough to have to write; but the receipt of letters is the death
of all holiday feeling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out of my country and myself I go.&rsquo;&nbsp; I wish
to take a dive among new conditions for a while, as into another
element.&nbsp; I have nothing to do with my friends or my
affections for the time; when I came away, I left my heart at
home in a desk, or sent it forward with my portmanteau to await
me at my destination.&nbsp; After my journey is over, I shall not
fail to read your admirable letters with the attention they
deserve.&nbsp; But I have paid all this money, look you, and
paddled all these strokes, for no other purpose than to be
abroad; and yet you keep me at home with your perpetual
communications.&nbsp; You tug the string, and I feel that I am a
tethered bird.&nbsp; You pursue me all over Europe with the
little vexations that I came away to avoid.&nbsp; There is no
discharge in the war of life, I am well aware; but shall there
not be so much as a week&rsquo;s furlough?</p>
<p>We were up by six, the day we were to leave.&nbsp; They had
taken so little note of us that I hardly thought they would have
condescended on a bill.&nbsp; But they did, with some smart
particulars too; and we paid in a civilised manner to an
uninterested clerk, and went out of that hotel, with the
india-rubber bags, unremarked.&nbsp; No one cared to know about
us.&nbsp; It is not possible to rise before a village; but
Compi&egrave;gne was so grown a town, that it took its ease in
the morning; and we were up and away while it was still in
dressing-gown and slippers.&nbsp; The streets were left to people
washing door-steps; nobody was in full dress but the cavaliers
upon the town-hall; they were all washed with dew, spruce in
their gilding, and full of intelligence and a sense of
professional responsibility.&nbsp; <i>Kling</i> went they on the
bells for the half-past six as we went by.&nbsp; I took it kind
of them to make me this parting compliment; they never were in
better form, not even at noon upon a Sunday.</p>
<p>There was no one to see us off but the early
washerwomen&mdash;early and late&mdash;who were already beating
the linen in their floating lavatory on the river.&nbsp; They
were very merry and matutinal in their ways; plunged their arms
boldly in, and seemed not to feel the shock.&nbsp; It would be
dispiriting to me, this early beginning and first cold dabble of
a most dispiriting day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; But I believe they
would have been as unwilling to change days with us as we could
be to change with them.&nbsp; They crowded to the door to watch
us paddle away into the thin sunny mists upon the river; and
shouted heartily after us till we were through the bridge.</p>

157</span>CHANGED TIMES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a sense in which those
mists never rose from off our journey; and from that time forth
they lie very densely in my note-book.&nbsp; As long as the Oise
was a small rural river, it took us near by people&rsquo;s doors,
and we could hold a conversation with natives in the riparian
fields.&nbsp; But now that it had grown so wide, the life along
shore passed us by at a distance.&nbsp; It was the same
difference as between a great public highway and a country
by-path that wanders in and out of cottage gardens.&nbsp; We now
lay in towns, where nobody troubled us with questions; we had
floated into civilised life, where people pass without
salutation.&nbsp; In sparsely inhabited places, we make all we
can of each encounter; but when it comes to a city, we keep to
ourselves, and never speak unless we have trodden on a
man&rsquo;s toes.&nbsp; In these waters we were no longer strange
birds, and nobody supposed we had travelled farther than from the
last town.&nbsp; I remember, when we came into L&rsquo;Isle Adam,
for instance, how we met dozens of pleasure-boats outing it for
the afternoon, and there was nothing to distinguish the true
voyager from the amateur, except, perhaps, the filthy condition
of my sail.&nbsp; The company in one boat actually thought they
recognised me for a neighbour.&nbsp; Was there ever anything more
wounding?&nbsp; All the romance had come down to that.&nbsp; Now,
on the upper Oise, where nothing sailed as a general thing but
fish, a pair of canoeists could not be thus vulgarly explained
away; we were strange and picturesque intruders; and out of
people&rsquo;s wonder sprang a sort of light and passing intimacy
all along our route.&nbsp; There is nothing but tit-for-tat in
this world, though sometimes it be a little difficult to trace:
for the scores are older than we ourselves, and there has never
yet been a settling-day since things were.&nbsp; You get
entertainment pretty much in proportion as you give.&nbsp; As
long as we were a sort of odd wanderers, to be stared at and
followed like a quack doctor or a caravan, we had no want of
amusement in return; but as soon as we sank into commonplace
ourselves, all whom we met were similarly disenchanted.&nbsp; And
here is one reason of a dozen, why the world is dull to dull
persons.</p>
<p>In our earlier adventures there was generally something to do,
and that quickened us.&nbsp; Even the showers of rain had a
revivifying effect, and shook up the brain from torpor.&nbsp; But
now, when the river no longer ran in a proper sense, only glided
seaward with an even, outright, but imperceptible speed, and when
the sky smiled upon us day after day without variety, we began to
slip into that golden doze of the mind which follows upon much
exercise in the open air.&nbsp; I have stupefied myself in this
way more than once; indeed, I dearly love the feeling; but I
never had it to the same degree as when paddling down the
Oise.&nbsp; It was the apotheosis of stupidity.</p>
<p>We ceased reading entirely.&nbsp; Sometimes when I found a new
paper, I took a particular pleasure in reading a single number of
the current novel; but I never could bear more than three
instalments; and even the second was a disappointment.&nbsp; As
soon as the tale became in any way perspicuous, it lost all merit
in my eyes; only a single scene, or, as is the way with these
<i>feuilletons</i>, half a scene, without antecedent or
consequence, like a piece of a dream, had the knack of fixing my
interest.&nbsp; The less I saw of the novel, the better I liked
it: a pregnant reflection.&nbsp; But for the most part, as I
said, we neither of us read anything in the world, and employed
the very little while we were awake between bed and dinner in
poring upon maps.&nbsp; I have always been fond of maps, and can
voyage in an atlas with the greatest enjoyment.&nbsp; The names
of places are singularly inviting; the contour of coasts and
rivers is enthralling to the eye; and to hit, in a map, upon some
place you have heard of before, makes history a new
possession.&nbsp; But we thumbed our charts, on these evenings,
with the blankest unconcern.&nbsp; We cared not a fraction for
this place or that.&nbsp; We stared at the sheet as children
listen to their rattle; and read the names of towns or villages
to forget them again at once.&nbsp; We had no romance in the
matter; there was nobody so fancy-free.&nbsp; If you had taken
the maps away while we were studying them most intently, it is a
fair bet whether we might not have continued to study the table
with the same delight.</p>
<p>About one thing we were mightily taken up, and that was
eating.&nbsp; I think I made a god of my belly.&nbsp; I remember
dwelling in imagination upon this or that dish till my mouth
watered; and long before we got in for the night my appetite was
a clamant, instant annoyance.&nbsp; Sometimes we paddled
alongside for a while and whetted each other with gastronomical
fancies as we went.&nbsp; Cake and sherry, a homely rejection,
but not within reach upon the Oise, trotted through my head for
many a mile; and once, as we were approaching Verberie, the
<i>Cigarette</i> brought my heart into my mouth by the suggestion
of oyster-patties and Sauterne.</p>
<p>I suppose none of us recognise the great part that is played
in life by eating and drinking.&nbsp; The appetite is so
imperious that we can stomach the least interesting viands, and
pass off a dinner-hour thankfully enough on bread and water; just
as there are men who must read something, if it were only
<i>Bradshaw&rsquo;s Guide</i>.&nbsp; But there is a romance about
the matter after all.&nbsp; Probably the table has more devotees
than love; and I am sure that food is much more generally
entertaining than scenery.&nbsp; Do you give in, as Walt Whitman
would say, that you are any the less immortal for that?&nbsp; The
true materialism is to be ashamed of what we are.&nbsp; To detect
the flavour of an olive is no less a piece of human perfection
than to find beauty in the colours of the sunset.</p>
<p>Canoeing was easy work.&nbsp; To dip the paddle at the proper
inclination, now right, now left; to keep the head down stream;
to empty the little pool that gathered in the lap of the apron;
to screw up the eyes against the glittering sparkles of sun upon
the water; or now and again to pass below the whistling tow-rope
of the <i>Deo Gratias</i> of Cond&eacute;, or the <i>Four Sons of
Aymon</i>&mdash;there was not much art in that; certain silly
muscles managed it between sleep and waking; and meanwhile the
brain had a whole holiday, and went to sleep.&nbsp; We took in,
at a glance, the larger features of the scene; and beheld, with
half an eye, bloused fishers and dabbling washerwomen on the
bank.&nbsp; Now and again we might be half-wakened by some church
spire, by a leaping fish, or by a trail of river grass that clung
about the paddle and had to be plucked off and thrown away.&nbsp;
But these luminous intervals were only partially luminous.&nbsp;
A little more of us was called into action, but never the
whole.&nbsp; The central bureau of nerves, what in some moods we
call Ourselves, enjoyed its holiday without disturbance, like a
Government Office.&nbsp; The great wheels of intelligence turned
idly in the head, like fly-wheels, grinding no grist.&nbsp; I
have gone on for half an hour at a time, counting my strokes and
forgetting the hundreds.&nbsp; I flatter myself the beasts that
perish could not underbid that, as a low form of
consciousness.&nbsp; And what a pleasure it was!&nbsp; What a
hearty, tolerant temper did it bring about!&nbsp; There is
nothing captious about a man who has attained to this, the one
possible apotheosis in life, the Apotheosis of Stupidity; and he
begins to feel dignified and long&aelig;vous like a tree.</p>
<p>There was one odd piece of practical metaphysics which
accompanied what I may call the depth, if I must not call it the
intensity, of my abstraction.&nbsp; What philosophers call
<i>me</i> and <i>not-me</i>, <i>ego</i> and <i>non ego</i>,
preoccupied me whether I would or no.&nbsp; There was less
<i>me</i> and more <i>not-me</i> than I was accustomed to
expect.&nbsp; I looked on upon somebody else, who managed the
paddling; I was aware of somebody else&rsquo;s feet against the
stretcher; my own body seemed to have no more intimate relation
to me than the canoe, or the river, or the river banks.&nbsp; Nor
this alone: something inside my mind, a part of my brain, a
province of my proper being, had thrown off allegiance and set up
for itself, or perhaps for the somebody else who did the
paddling.&nbsp; I had dwindled into quite a little thing in a
corner of myself.&nbsp; I was isolated in my own skull.&nbsp;
Thoughts presented themselves unbidden; they were not my
thoughts, they were plainly some one else&rsquo;s; and I
considered them like a part of the landscape.&nbsp; I take it, in
short, that I was about as near Nirvana as would be convenient in
practical life; and if this be so, I make the Buddhists my
sincere compliments; &rsquo;tis an agreeable state, not very
consistent with mental brilliancy, not exactly profitable in a
money point of view, but very calm, golden, and incurious, and
one that sets a man superior to alarms.&nbsp; It may be best
figured by supposing yourself to get dead drunk, and yet keep
sober to enjoy it.&nbsp; I have a notion that open-air labourers
must spend a large portion of their days in this ecstatic stupor,
which explains their high composure and endurance.&nbsp; A pity
to go to the expense of laudanum, when here is a better paradise
for nothing!</p>
<p>This frame of mind was the great exploit of our voyage, take
it all in all.&nbsp; It was the farthest piece of travel
accomplished.&nbsp; Indeed, it lies so far from beaten paths of
language, that I despair of getting the reader into sympathy with
the smiling, complacent idiocy of my condition; when ideas came
and went like motes in a sunbeam; when trees and church spires
along the bank surged up, from time to time into my notice, like
solid objects through a rolling cloudland; when the rhythmical
swish of boat and paddle in the water became a cradle-song to
lull my thoughts asleep; when a piece of mud on the deck was
sometimes an intolerable eyesore, and sometimes quite a companion
for me, and the object of pleased consideration;&mdash;and all
the time, with the river running and the shores changing upon
either hand, I kept counting my strokes and forgetting the
hundreds, the happiest animal in France.</p>
<h2><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>DOWN
THE OISE: CHURCH INTERIORS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> made our first stage below
Compi&egrave;gne to Pont Sainte Maxence.&nbsp; I was abroad a
little after six the next morning.&nbsp; The air was biting, and
smelt of frost.&nbsp; In an open place a score of women wrangled
together over the day&rsquo;s market; and the noise of their
negotiation sounded thin and querulous like that of sparrows on a
winter&rsquo;s morning.&nbsp; The rare passengers blew into their
hands, and shuffled in their wooden shoes to set the blood
agog.&nbsp; The streets were full of icy shadow, although the
chimneys were smoking overhead in golden sunshine.&nbsp; If you
wake early enough at this season of the year, you may get up in
December to break your fast in June.</p>
<p>I found my way to the church; for there is always something to
see about a church, whether living worshippers or dead
men&rsquo;s tombs; you find there the deadliest earnest, and the
hollowest deceit; and even where it is not a piece of history, it
will be certain to leak out some contemporary gossip.&nbsp; It
was scarcely so cold in the church as it was without, but it
looked colder.&nbsp; The white nave was positively arctic to the
eye; and the tawdriness of a continental altar looked more
forlorn than usual in the solitude and the bleak air.&nbsp; Two
priests sat in the chancel, reading and waiting penitents; and
out in the nave, one very old woman was engaged in her
devotions.&nbsp; It was a wonder how she was able to pass her
beads when healthy young people were breathing in their palms and
slapping their chest; but though this concerned me, I was yet
more dispirited by the nature of her exercises.&nbsp; She went
from chair to chair, from altar to altar, circumnavigating the
church.&nbsp; To each shrine she dedicated an equal number of
beads and an equal length of time.&nbsp; Like a prudent
capitalist with a somewhat cynical view of the commercial
prospect, she desired to place her supplications in a great
variety of heavenly securities.&nbsp; She would risk nothing on
the credit of any single intercessor.&nbsp; Out of the whole
company of saints and angels, not one but was to suppose himself
her champion elect against the Great Assize!&nbsp; I could only
think of it as a dull, transparent jugglery, based upon
unconscious unbelief.</p>
<p>She was as dead an old woman as ever I saw; no more than bone
and parchment, curiously put together.&nbsp; Her eyes, with which
she interrogated mine, were vacant of sense.&nbsp; It depends on
what you call seeing, whether you might not call her blind.&nbsp;
Perhaps she had known love: perhaps borne children, suckled them
and given them pet names.&nbsp; But now that was all gone by, and
had left her neither happier nor wiser; and the best she could do
with her mornings was to come up here into the cold church and
juggle for a slice of heaven.&nbsp; It was not without a gulp
that I escaped into the streets and the keen morning air.&nbsp;
Morning? why, how tired of it she would be before night! and if
she did not sleep, how then?&nbsp; It is fortunate that not many
of us are brought up publicly to justify our lives at the bar of
threescore years and ten; fortunate that such a number are
knocked opportunely on the head in what they call the flower of
their years, and go away to suffer for their follies in private
somewhere else.&nbsp; Otherwise, between sick children and
discontented old folk, we might be put out of all conceit of
life.</p>
<p>I had need of all my cerebral hygiene during that day&rsquo;s
paddle: the old devotee stuck in my throat sorely.&nbsp; But I
was soon in the seventh heaven of stupidity; and knew nothing but
that somebody was paddling a canoe, while I was counting his
strokes and forgetting the hundreds.&nbsp; I used sometimes to be
afraid I should remember the hundreds; which would have made a
toil of a pleasure; but the terror was chimerical, they went out
of my mind by enchantment, and I knew no more than the man in the
moon about my only occupation.</p>
<p>At Creil, where we stopped to lunch, we left the canoes in
another floating lavatory, which, as it was high noon, was packed
with washerwomen, red-handed and loud-voiced; and they and their
broad jokes are about all I remember of the place.&nbsp; I could
look up my history-books, if you were very anxious, and tell you
a date or two; for it figured rather largely in the English
wars.&nbsp; But I prefer to mention a girls&rsquo;
boarding-school, which had an interest for us because it was a
girls&rsquo; boarding-school, and because we imagined we had
rather an interest for it.&nbsp; At least&mdash;there were the
girls about the garden; and here were we on the river; and there
was more than one handkerchief waved as we went by.&nbsp; It
caused quite a stir in my heart; and yet how we should have
wearied and despised each other, these girls and I, if we had
been introduced at a croquet-party!&nbsp; But this is a fashion I
love: to kiss the hand or wave a handkerchief to people I shall
never see again, to play with possibility, and knock in a peg for
fancy to hang upon.&nbsp; It gives the traveller a jog, reminds
him that he is not a traveller everywhere, and that his journey
is no more than a siesta by the way on the real march of
life.</p>
<p>The church at Creil was a nondescript place in the inside,
splashed with gaudy lights from the windows, and picked out with
medallions of the Dolorous Way.&nbsp; But there was one oddity,
in the way of an <i>ex voto</i>, which pleased me hugely: a
faithful model of a canal boat, swung from the vault, with a
written aspiration that God should conduct the <i>Saint
Nicolas</i> of Creil to a good haven.&nbsp; The thing was neatly
executed, and would have made the delight of a party of boys on
the waterside.&nbsp; But what tickled me was the gravity of the
peril to be conjured.&nbsp; You might hang up the model of a
sea-going ship, and welcome: one that is to plough a furrow round
the world, and visit the tropic or the frosty poles, runs dangers
that are well worth a candle and a mass.&nbsp; But the <i>Saint
Nicolas</i> of Creil, which was to be tugged for some ten years
by patient draught-horses, in a weedy canal, with the poplars
chattering overhead, and the skipper whistling at the tiller;
which was to do all its errands in green inland places, and never
get out of sight of a village belfry in all its cruising; why,
you would have thought if anything could be done without the
intervention of Providence, it would be that!&nbsp; But perhaps
the skipper was a humorist: or perhaps a prophet, reminding
people of the seriousness of life by this preposterous token.</p>
<p>At Creil, as at Noyon, Saint Joseph seemed a favourite saint
on the score of punctuality.&nbsp; Day and hour can be specified;
and grateful people do not fail to specify them on a votive
tablet, when prayers have been punctually and neatly
answered.&nbsp; Whenever time is a consideration, Saint Joseph is
the proper intermediary.&nbsp; I took a sort of pleasure in
observing the vogue he had in France, for the good man plays a
very small part in my religion at home.&nbsp; Yet I could not
help fearing that, where the Saint is so much commanded for
exactitude, he will be expected to be very grateful for his
tablet.</p>
<p>This is foolishness to us Protestants; and not of great
importance anyway.&nbsp; Whether people&rsquo;s gratitude for the
good gifts that come to them be wisely conceived or dutifully
expressed, is a secondary matter, after all, so long as they feel
gratitude.&nbsp; The true ignorance is when a man does not know
that he has received a good gift, or begins to imagine that he
has got it for himself.&nbsp; The self-made man is the funniest
windbag after all!&nbsp; There is a marked difference between
decreeing light in chaos, and lighting the gas in a metropolitan
back-parlour with a box of patent matches; and do what we will,
there is always something made to our hand, if it were only our
fingers.</p>
<p>But there was something worse than foolishness placarded in
Creil Church.&nbsp; The Association of the Living Rosary (of
which I had never previously heard) is responsible for
that.&nbsp; This Association was founded, according to the
printed advertisement, by a brief of Pope Gregory Sixteenth, on
the 17th of January 1832: according to a coloured bas-relief, it
seems to have been founded, sometime other, by the Virgin giving
one rosary to Saint Dominic, and the Infant Saviour giving
another to Saint Catharine of Siena.&nbsp; Pope Gregory is not so
imposing, but he is nearer hand.&nbsp; I could not distinctly
make out whether the Association was entirely devotional, or had
an eye to good works; at least it is highly organised: the names
of fourteen matrons and misses were filled in for each week of
the month as associates, with one other, generally a married
woman, at the top for <i>z&eacute;latrice</i>: the leader of the
band.&nbsp; Indulgences, plenary and partial, follow on the
performance of the duties of the Association.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
partial indulgences are attached to the recitation of the
rosary.&rsquo;&nbsp; On &lsquo;the recitation of the required
<i>dizaine</i>,&rsquo; a partial indulgence promptly
follows.&nbsp; When people serve the kingdom of heaven with a
pass-book in their hands, I should always be afraid lest they
should carry the same commercial spirit into their dealings with
their fellow-men, which would make a sad and sordid business of
this life.</p>
<p>There is one more article, however, of happier import.&nbsp;
&lsquo;All these indulgences,&rsquo; it appeared, &lsquo;are
applicable to souls in purgatory.&rsquo;&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s
sake, ye ladies of Creil, apply them all to the souls in
purgatory without delay!&nbsp; Burns would take no hire for his
last songs, preferring to serve his country out of unmixed
love.&nbsp; Suppose you were to imitate the exciseman, mesdames,
and even if the souls in purgatory were not greatly bettered,
some souls in Creil upon the Oise would find themselves none the
worse either here or hereafter.</p>
<p>I cannot help wondering, as I transcribe these notes, whether
a Protestant born and bred is in a fit state to understand these
signs, and do them what justice they deserve; and I cannot help
answering that he is not.&nbsp; They cannot look so merely ugly
and mean to the faithful as they do to me.&nbsp; I see that as
clearly as a proposition in Euclid.&nbsp; For these believers are
neither weak nor wicked.&nbsp; They can put up their tablet
commanding Saint Joseph for his despatch, as if he were still a
village carpenter; they can &lsquo;recite the required
<i>dizaine</i>,&rsquo; and metaphorically pocket the indulgence,
as if they had done a job for Heaven; and then they can go out
and look down unabashed upon this wonderful river flowing by, and
up without confusion at the pin-point stars, which are themselves
great worlds full of flowing rivers greater than the Oise.&nbsp;
I see it as plainly, I say, as a proposition in Euclid, that my
Protestant mind has missed the point, and that there goes with
these deformities some higher and more religious spirit than I
dream.</p>
<p>I wonder if other people would make the same allowances for
me!&nbsp; Like the ladies of Creil, having recited my rosary of
toleration, I look for my indulgence on the spot.</p>
<h2><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>PR&Eacute;CY AND THE MARIONNETTES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> made Pr&eacute;cy about
sundown.&nbsp; The plain is rich with tufts of poplar.&nbsp; In a
wide, luminous curve, the Oise lay under the hillside.&nbsp; A
faint mist began to rise and confound the different distances
together.&nbsp; There was not a sound audible but that of the
sheep-bells in some meadows by the river, and the creaking of a
cart down the long road that descends the hill.&nbsp; The villas
in their gardens, the shops along the street, all seemed to have
been deserted the day before; and I felt inclined to walk
discreetly as one feels in a silent forest.&nbsp; All of a
sudden, we came round a corner, and there, in a little green
round the church, was a bevy of girls in Parisian costumes
playing croquet.&nbsp; Their laughter, and the hollow sound of
ball and mallet, made a cheery stir in the neighbourhood; and the
look of these slim figures, all corseted and ribboned, produced
an answerable disturbance in our hearts.&nbsp; We were within
sniff of Paris, it seemed.&nbsp; And here were females of our own
species playing croquet, just as if Pr&eacute;cy had been a place
in real life, instead of a stage in the fairyland of
travel.&nbsp; For, to be frank, the peasant woman is scarcely to
be counted as a woman at all, and after having passed by such a
succession of people in petticoats digging and hoeing and making
dinner, this company of coquettes under arms made quite a
surprising feature in the landscape, and convinced us at once of
being fallible males.</p>
<p>The inn at Pr&eacute;cy is the worst inn in France.&nbsp; Not
even in Scotland have I found worse fare.&nbsp; It was kept by a
brother and sister, neither of whom was out of their teens.&nbsp;
The sister, so to speak, prepared a meal for us; and the brother,
who had been tippling, came in and brought with him a tipsy
butcher, to entertain us as we ate.&nbsp; We found pieces of
loo-warm pork among the salad, and pieces of unknown yielding
substance in the <i>rago&ucirc;t</i>.&nbsp; The butcher
entertained us with pictures of Parisian life, with which he
professed himself well acquainted; the brother sitting the while
on the edge of the billiard-table, toppling precariously, and
sucking the stump of a cigar.&nbsp; In the midst of these
diversions, bang went a drum past the house, and a hoarse voice
began issuing a proclamation.&nbsp; It was a man with
marionnettes announcing a performance for that evening.</p>
<p>He had set up his caravan and lighted his candles on another
part of the girls&rsquo; croquet-green, under one of those open
sheds which are so common in France to shelter markets; and he
and his wife, by the time we strolled up there, were trying to
keep order with the audience.</p>
<p>It was the most absurd contention.&nbsp; The show-people had
set out a certain number of benches; and all who sat upon them
were to pay a couple of <i>sous</i> for the accommodation.&nbsp;
They were always quite full&mdash;a bumper house&mdash;as long as
nothing was going forward; but let the show-woman appear with an
eye to a collection, and at the first rattle of her tambourine
the audience slipped off the seats, and stood round on the
outside with their hands in their pockets.&nbsp; It certainly
would have tried an angel&rsquo;s temper.&nbsp; The showman
roared from the proscenium; he had been all over France, and
nowhere, nowhere, &lsquo;not even on the borders of
Germany,&rsquo; had he met with such misconduct.&nbsp; Such
thieves and rogues and rascals, as he called them!&nbsp; And
every now and again, the wife issued on another round, and added
her shrill quota to the tirade.&nbsp; I remarked here, as
elsewhere, how far more copious is the female mind in the
material of insult.&nbsp; The audience laughed in high
good-humour over the man&rsquo;s declamations; but they bridled
and cried aloud under the woman&rsquo;s pungent sallies.&nbsp;
She picked out the sore points.&nbsp; She had the honour of the
village at her mercy.&nbsp; Voices answered her angrily out of
the crowd, and received a smarting retort for their
trouble.&nbsp; A couple of old ladies beside me, who had duly
paid for their seats, waxed very red and indignant, and
discoursed to each other audibly about the impudence of these
mountebanks; but as soon as the show-woman caught a whisper of
this, she was down upon them with a swoop: if mesdames could
persuade their neighbours to act with common honesty, the
mountebanks, she assured them, would be polite enough: mesdames
had probably had their bowl of soup, and perhaps a glass of wine
that evening; the mountebanks also had a taste for soup, and did
not choose to have their little earnings stolen from them before
their eyes.&nbsp; Once, things came as far as a brief personal
encounter between the showman and some lads, in which the former
went down as readily as one of his own marionnettes to a peal of
jeering laughter.</p>
<p>I was a good deal astonished at this scene, because I am
pretty well acquainted with the ways of French strollers, more or
less artistic; and have always found them singularly
pleasing.&nbsp; Any stroller must be dear to the right-thinking
heart; if it were only as a living protest against offices and
the mercantile spirit, and as something to remind us that life is
not by necessity the kind of thing we generally make it.&nbsp;
Even a German band, if you see it leaving town in the early
morning for a campaign in country places, among trees and
meadows, has a romantic flavour for the imagination.&nbsp; There
is nobody, under thirty, so dead but his heart will stir a little
at sight of a gypsies&rsquo; camp.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are not
cotton-spinners all&rsquo;; or, at least, not all through.&nbsp;
There is some life in humanity yet: and youth will now and again
find a brave word to say in dispraise of riches, and throw up a
situation to go strolling with a knapsack.</p>
<p>An Englishman has always special facilities for intercourse
with French gymnasts; for England is the natural home of
gymnasts.&nbsp; This or that fellow, in his tights and spangles,
is sure to know a word or two of English, to have drunk English
<i>aff-&rsquo;n-aff</i>, and perhaps performed in an English
music-hall.&nbsp; He is a countryman of mine by profession.&nbsp;
He leaps, like the Belgian boating men, to the notion that I must
be an athlete myself.</p>
<p>But the gymnast is not my favourite; he has little or no
tincture of the artist in his composition; his soul is small and
pedestrian, for the most part, since his profession makes no call
upon it, and does not accustom him to high ideas.&nbsp; But if a
man is only so much of an actor that he can stumble through a
farce, he is made free of a new order of thoughts.&nbsp; He has
something else to think about beside the money-box.&nbsp; He has
a pride of his own, and, what is of far more importance, he has
an aim before him that he can never quite attain.&nbsp; He has
gone upon a pilgrimage that will last him his life long, because
there is no end to it short of perfection.&nbsp; He will better
upon himself a little day by day; or even if he has given up the
attempt, he will always remember that once upon a time he had
conceived this high ideal, that once upon a time he had fallen in
love with a star.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis better to have loved
and lost.&rsquo;&nbsp; Although the moon should have nothing to
say to Endymion, although he should settle down with Audrey and
feed pigs, do you not think he would move with a better grace,
and cherish higher thoughts to the end?&nbsp; The louts he meets
at church never had a fancy above Audrey&rsquo;s snood; but there
is a reminiscence in Endymion&rsquo;s heart that, like a spice,
keeps it fresh and haughty.</p>
<p>To be even one of the outskirters of art, leaves a fine stamp
on a man&rsquo;s countenance.&nbsp; I remember once dining with a
party in the inn at Ch&acirc;teau Landon.&nbsp; Most of them were
unmistakable bagmen; others well-to-do peasantry; but there was
one young fellow in a blouse, whose face stood out from among the
rest surprisingly.&nbsp; It looked more finished; more of the
spirit looked out through it; it had a living, expressive air,
and you could see that his eyes took things in.&nbsp; My
companion and I wondered greatly who and what he could be.&nbsp;
It was fair-time in Ch&acirc;teau Landon, and when we went along
to the booths, we had our question answered; for there was our
friend busily fiddling for the peasants to caper to.&nbsp; He was
a wandering violinist.</p>
<p>A troop of strollers once came to the inn where I was staying,
in the department of Seine et Marne.&nbsp; There was a father and
mother; two daughters, brazen, blowsy hussies, who sang and
acted, without an idea of how to set about either; and a dark
young man, like a tutor, a recalcitrant house-painter, who sang
and acted not amiss.&nbsp; The mother was the genius of the
party, so far as genius can be spoken of with regard to such a
pack of incompetent humbugs; and her husband could not find words
to express his admiration for her comic countryman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You should see my old woman,&rsquo; said he, and nodded
his beery countenance.&nbsp; One night they performed in the
stable-yard, with flaring lamps&mdash;a wretched exhibition,
coldly looked upon by a village audience.&nbsp; Next night, as
soon as the lamps were lighted, there came a plump of rain, and
they had to sweep away their baggage as fast as possible, and
make off to the barn where they harboured, cold, wet, and
supperless.&nbsp; In the morning, a dear friend of mine, who has
as warm a heart for strollers as I have myself, made a little
collection, and sent it by my hands to comfort them for their
disappointment.&nbsp; I gave it to the father; he thanked me
cordially, and we drank a cup together in the kitchen, talking of
roads, and audiences, and hard times.</p>
<p>When I was going, up got my old stroller, and off with his
hat.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that
Monsieur will think me altogether a beggar; but I have another
demand to make upon him.&rsquo;&nbsp; I began to hate him on the
spot.&nbsp; &lsquo;We play again to-night,&rsquo; he went
on.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course, I shall refuse to accept any more
money from Monsieur and his friends, who have been already so
liberal.&nbsp; But our programme of to-night is something truly
creditable; and I cling to the idea that Monsieur will honour us
with his presence.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, with a shrug and a
smile: &lsquo;Monsieur understands&mdash;the vanity of an
artist!&rsquo;&nbsp; Save the mark!&nbsp; The vanity of an
artist!&nbsp; That is the kind of thing that reconciles me to
life: a ragged, tippling, incompetent old rogue, with the manners
of a gentleman, and the vanity of an artist, to keep up his
self-respect!</p>
<p>But the man after my own heart is M. de Vauversin.&nbsp; It is
nearly two years since I saw him first, and indeed I hope I may
see him often again.&nbsp; Here is his first programme, as I
found it on the breakfast-table, and have kept it ever since as a
relic of bright days:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<i>Mesdames et Messieurs</i>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Mademoiselle Ferrario et M. de Vauversin auront
l&rsquo;honneur de chanter ce soir les morceaux suivants</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Madermoiselle Ferrario
chantera&mdash;Mignon&mdash;Oiseaux
L&eacute;gers&mdash;France&mdash;Des Fran&ccedil;ais dorment
l&agrave;&mdash;Le ch&acirc;teau bleu&mdash;O&ugrave; voulez-vous
aller</i>?</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>M. de Vauversin&mdash;Madame Fontaine et M.
Robinet&mdash;Les plongeurs &agrave; cheval&mdash;Le Mari
m&eacute;content&mdash;Tais-toi, gamin&mdash;Mon voisin
l&rsquo;original&mdash;Heureux comme &ccedil;a&mdash;Comme on est
tromp&eacute;</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They made a stage at one end of the
<i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i>.&nbsp; And what a sight it was to
see M. de Vauversin, with a cigarette in his mouth, twanging a
guitar, and following Mademoiselle Ferrario&rsquo;s eyes with the
obedient, kindly look of a dog!&nbsp; The entertainment wound up
with a tombola, or auction of lottery tickets: an admirable
amusement, with all the excitement of gambling, and no hope of
gain to make you ashamed of your eagerness; for there, all is
loss; you make haste to be out of pocket; it is a competition who
shall lose most money for the benefit of M. de Vauversin and
Mademoiselle Ferrario.</p>
<p>M. de Vauversin is a small man, with a great head of black
hair, a vivacious and engaging air, and a smile that would be
delightful if he had better teeth.&nbsp; He was once an actor in
the Ch&acirc;telet; but he contracted a nervous affection from
the heat and glare of the footlights, which unfitted him for the
stage.&nbsp; At this crisis Mademoiselle Ferrario, otherwise
Mademoiselle Rita of the Alcazar, agreed to share his wandering
fortunes.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could never forget the generosity of
that lady,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; He wears trousers so tight that
it has long been a problem to all who knew him how he manages to
get in and out of them.&nbsp; He sketches a little in
water-colours; he writes verses; he is the most patient of
fishermen, and spent long days at the bottom of the inn-garden
fruitlessly dabbling a line in the clear river.</p>
<p>You should hear him recounting his experiences over a bottle
of wine; such a pleasant vein of talk as he has, with a ready
smile at his own mishaps, and every now and then a sudden
gravity, like a man who should hear the surf roar while he was
telling the perils of the deep.&nbsp; For it was no longer ago
than last night, perhaps, that the receipts only amounted to a
franc and a half, to cover three francs of railway fare and two
of board and lodging.&nbsp; The Maire, a man worth a million of
money, sat in the front seat, repeatedly applauding Mlle.
Ferrario, and yet gave no more than three <i>sous</i> the whole
evening.&nbsp; Local authorities look with such an evil eye upon
the strolling artist.&nbsp; Alas! I know it well, who have been
myself taken for one, and pitilessly incarcerated on the strength
of the misapprehension.&nbsp; Once, M. de Vauversin visited a
commissary of police for permission to sing.&nbsp; The
commissary, who was smoking at his ease, politely doffed his hat
upon the singer&rsquo;s entrance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
Commissary,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;I am an artist.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And on went the commissary&rsquo;s hat again.&nbsp; No courtesy
for the companions of Apollo!&nbsp; &lsquo;They are as degraded
as that,&rsquo; said M. de Vauversin with a sweep of his
cigarette.</p>
<p>But what pleased me most was one outbreak of his, when we had
been talking all the evening of the rubs, indignities, and
pinchings of his wandering life.&nbsp; Some one said, it would be
better to have a million of money down, and Mlle. Ferrario
admitted that she would prefer that mightily.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Eh
bien</i>, <i>moi non</i>;&mdash;not I,&rsquo; cried De Vauversin,
striking the table with his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;If any one is a
failure in the world, is it not I?&nbsp; I had an art, in which I
have done things well&mdash;as well as some&mdash;better perhaps
than others; and now it is closed against me.&nbsp; I must go
about the country gathering coppers and singing nonsense.&nbsp;
Do you think I regret my life?&nbsp; Do you think I would rather
be a fat burgess, like a calf?&nbsp; Not I!&nbsp; I have had
moments when I have been applauded on the boards: I think nothing
of that; but I have known in my own mind sometimes, when I had
not a clap from the whole house, that I had found a true
intonation, or an exact and speaking gesture; and then,
messieurs, I have known what pleasure was, what it was to do a
thing well, what it was to be an artist.&nbsp; And to know what
art is, is to have an interest for ever, such as no burgess can
find in his petty concerns.&nbsp; <i>Tenez</i>, <i>messieurs</i>,
<i>je vais vous le dire</i>&mdash;it is like a
religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such, making some allowance for the tricks of memory and the
inaccuracies of translation, was the profession of faith of M. de
Vauversin.&nbsp; I have given him his own name, lest any other
wanderer should come across him, with his guitar and cigarette,
and Mademoiselle Ferrario; for should not all the world delight
to honour this unfortunate and loyal follower of the Muses?&nbsp;
May Apollo send him rimes hitherto undreamed of; may the river be
no longer scanty of her silver fishes to his lure; may the cold
not pinch him on long winter rides, nor the village
jack-in-office affront him with unseemly manners; and may he
never miss Mademoiselle Ferrario from his side, to follow with
his dutiful eyes and accompany on the guitar!</p>
<p>The marionnettes made a very dismal entertainment.&nbsp; They
performed a piece, called <i>Pyramus and Thisbe</i>, in five
mortal acts, and all written in Alexandrines fully as long as the
performers.&nbsp; One marionnette was the king; another the
wicked counsellor; a third, credited with exceptional beauty,
represented Thisbe; and then there were guards, and obdurate
fathers, and walking gentlemen.&nbsp; Nothing particular took
place during the two or three acts that I sat out; but you will
he pleased to learn that the unities were properly respected, and
the whole piece, with one exception, moved in harmony with
classical rules.&nbsp; That exception was the comic countryman, a
lean marionnette in wooden shoes, who spoke in prose and in a
broad <i>patois</i> much appreciated by the audience.&nbsp; He
took unconstitutional liberties with the person of his sovereign;
kicked his fellow-marionnettes in the mouth with his wooden
shoes, and whenever none of the versifying suitors were about,
made love to Thisbe on his own account in comic prose.</p>
<p>This fellow&rsquo;s evolutions, and the little prologue, in
which the showman made a humorous eulogium of his troop, praising
their indifference to applause and hisses, and their single
devotion to their art, were the only circumstances in the whole
affair that you could fancy would so much as raise a smile.&nbsp;
But the villagers of Pr&eacute;cy seemed delighted.&nbsp; Indeed,
so long as a thing is an exhibition, and you pay to see it, it is
nearly certain to amuse.&nbsp; If we were charged so much a head
for sunsets, or if God sent round a drum before the hawthorns
came in flower, what a work should we not make about their
beauty!&nbsp; But these things, like good companions, stupid
people early cease to observe: and the Abstract Bagman tittups
past in his spring gig, and is positively not aware of the
flowers along the lane, or the scenery of the weather
overhead.</p>
<h2><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>BACK
TO THE WORLD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the next two days&rsquo; sail
little remains in my mind, and nothing whatever in my
note-book.&nbsp; The river streamed on steadily through pleasant
river-side landscapes.&nbsp; Washerwomen in blue dresses, fishers
in blue blouses, diversified the green banks; and the relation of
the two colours was like that of the flower and the leaf in the
forget-me-not.&nbsp; A symphony in forget-me-not; I think
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier might thus have characterised that two
days&rsquo; panorama.&nbsp; The sky was blue and cloudless; and
the sliding surface of the river held up, in smooth places, a
mirror to the heaven and the shores.&nbsp; The washerwomen hailed
us laughingly; and the noise of trees and water made an
accompaniment to our dozing thoughts, as we fleeted down the
stream.</p>
<p>The great volume, the indefatigable purpose of the river, held
the mind in chain.&nbsp; It seemed now so sure of its end, so
strong and easy in its gait, like a grown man full of
determination.&nbsp; The surf was roaring for it on the sands of
Havre.</p>
<p>For my own part, slipping along this moving thoroughfare in my
fiddle-case of a canoe, I also was beginning to grow aweary for
my ocean.&nbsp; To the civilised man, there must come, sooner or
later, a desire for civilisation.&nbsp; I was weary of dipping
the paddle; I was weary of living on the skirts of life; I wished
to be in the thick of it once more; I wished to get to work; I
wished to meet people who understood my own speech, and could
meet with me on equal terms, as a man, and no longer as a
curiosity.</p>
<p>And so a letter at Pontoise decided us, and we drew up our
keels for the last time out of that river of Oise that had
faithfully piloted them, through rain and sunshine, for so
long.&nbsp; For so many miles had this fleet and footless beast
of burthen charioted our fortunes, that we turned our back upon
it with a sense of separation.&nbsp; We had made a long
d&eacute;tour out of the world, but now we were back in the
familiar places, where life itself makes all the running, and we
are carried to meet adventure without a stroke of the
paddle.&nbsp; Now we were to return, like the voyager in the
play, and see what rearrangements fortune had perfected the while
in our surroundings; what surprises stood ready made for us at
home; and whither and how far the world had voyaged in our
absence.&nbsp; You may paddle all day long; but it is when you
come back at nightfall, and look in at the familiar room, that
you find Love or Death awaiting you beside the stove; and the
most beautiful adventures are not those we go to seek.</p>
